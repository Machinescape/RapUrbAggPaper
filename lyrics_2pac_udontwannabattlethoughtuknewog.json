gonna have two savage minds\nTwo ruthless battlers\nTwo gruesome souls\nGo live, right here\nIn this corner, MC Ryan D\nAnd up next is 2Pacalypse\n\n[Verse 1: 2Pac]\nYo I can rock it on a slow tip\nDon't flip, cause I can do this\nNo shit, won't trip, ain't nothin' to this\n2Pacalpyse, now jack you better brace\nCause I'm thumpin' it up and pumpin' it up with hellafied bass\nIf ya comp rolls, throw blows until they back down\nThey sweat, no threat, suckers I smack down\nNo joke, I smoke any and all punks\nThey step, mic check and then they get done\nWhat's next?, I flex and rock the dope TEC's\nGet drunk, then run through crews like group sex\nGet sprung, it's fun, out to hear the hoes\nHomeboys, make noise from back to front row's\nCause yo, I flow and go continually\n2Pac, non stop rippin' up scenery\nSo now, you know how I be rockin' shit\nWhen I flow, same hoe with the 2Pacalypse\n\n[2Pac Scarface]\nOoohh that's very good\nRemember the last to have the challenger from the phone ringing\nEat the package mayn\nAnd I'm Shock G and this [?]\n\n[Verse 2: Ryan D]\nTwo it's time to crunch and munch, your pussy ass see I had a hunch\nYou couldn't punch, I eat you for lunch\nAnd go through, your sorry crew, I thought you knew?\nYou punk motherfucker's could never do\nThe things I, The R the Y, the A the N, Daz D did bitch, you couldn't ever fade me\nI'm not a sucker, I treat you like a serious trick\nYou little dummy, you need to stop talkin' shit\nYou got nerve, I give you credit, to think you hang\nBut brother we're not all in the same gang\nThe punks, the suckers, the phonies, the perpetrators like you\nWould never even fit in a crew\nWithout suckin' a dick, or maybe robbin' a bank\nYou see you don't got talent and your breathe straight stank\nHoe, now step in line before I'm mad at you\nYou silly sucker ha, I thought you knew\n\n[2Pac Scarface]\nOoohh that was very good\nRyan D, very good\nBut let's give 2Pac a counter attack\n2Pac, step to the stage\nAnd may the best man win\n\n[Verse 3: 2Pac]\nHit dropper, shit stopper with the strength to motivate\nGive me a break, and then it's time to illustrate\n2Pac will terminate, cause niggas like to perpetrate\nRhymes I create, yo you best believe they're worth the wait\nSo here I go, I'm about to throw a dope flow\nAnd let them know 2Pac will hit you with a death blow\nBut you say no because you wanna battle blow for blow\nI'm nothin' nice and my advise is just to let it go\nI would just battle you but somehow I don't think it's fair\nI'm not an amateur, I'll damage ya and leave you there\nAnyway nigga I'm the one they want to hear from\nFuck that pussy shit that you be boppin' in they eardrum\nCause in the 90's boy, 2Pac is comin' through\nI'm in effect, snappin' necks, I thought you knew\n\n[2Pac Scarface]\nVery good, very good\nIt's time for Ryan D\nOnce more to come\nAnd meet 2Pac halfway\nIt's been a gruesome fight\nHere's your last chance\n\n[Verse 4: Ryan D]\nYou wanna talk about a battle?\nWell I'mma talk about a massacre\nYou soft sucker, I'm tryin' not to laugh at ya\nYou and your posse, just stepped into the circle of death\nYou thought I wouldn't but the gauge, was in effect\nI'm not a killer but I'm not exactly pro-life\nKeep actin' stupid I'mma stab you with my girl's knife\nI'm not a coward punk I'll walk into your livin' room\nChange the channel, and make you watch a cartoon\nAnd if you step, I hope you pack a serious nine\nCause if you don't, your sorry ass will be all mine\nCause I'm a warrior, I'll make a fire out of a stick\nLive in the jungle, but never comin' less than thick\nYou sorry maggot, you need to learn a lesson from me\nThe funky brother causin' trouble chief R Y D\nCause I'm no sucker, I'm laughin' at you and your crew\nYou'll never hang 2Pac, I thought you knew\n\n[2Pac Scarface]\nAww we're havin' a good fight here tonight\nLadies and gentlemen\nRyan D almost got points taken away for a low blow\n2Pac\nStep to the stage\nIt's on\n\n[Verse 5 : 2Pac]\nShall I say I'm beatable?\nNow out of the silent, I think conceded\nBut what more can I say, I've never been defeated\nBy a half steppin' mutha fucka clutchin' on the microphone\nSucker I'll break ya bones better leave 2Pac alone\nI ain't no trick\nI'll drop you and I'll drop you quick\nIt makes you sick\nBecause your bitch is on my dick\nBut who's to blame, the brotha with the strange name\nI show no shame, cause god gave the me the gift of game\nNow who are you?\nMutha fuck you and your crew\nYou think of drive by's, nigga I will drive through\nYou and your crew, you fuck around your girl too\nThe bitch is scandalous\nShe's fuckin' me and duckin' you\nSo fuck unbeatable, dope is what ya need to call it\nIf rap was liquor, I'd be a fuckin' alcholic\nThis ain't a threat\nJust showin' em how dope it gets\nWhen suckaz sweat\nIt's time to rock the roof, let's jet\nI go for broke\nCause like I said the rhymes are dope\nYou're on the ropes, cause mutha fucka I'm no joke\nIt's like I'm brain-locked, when I hit the tempo\nKick the intro, then it's time to get loc'd\nYa got beef g\nStep up 'fore it get swoll up\nIt's like a hold up\nDrop 'em or get rolled up\nI give a fuck\nIt's time to set the record straight\nThis nigga is dope (word)\nWhat more can I say?\n\n[Ryan D]\nAlright alright man, peace man\nYou got it good [?]\nJust wanna send a shout out to all my homeboys in\nThe J town, my DJ Clark Gable\nEverybody else y'all know you down with the\nDrank avenue posse, don't stop\n\n[2Pac]\nAyo peace to my homie Treach, Latifah\nThe whole flavor unit posse\nMy girl Yo-Yo, the whole Lench Mob posse\nCrazy shout outs to Ice Cube, Shock G, Money B\nPeace to the jungle\nPeace to my crew\nPeace to my homies\nWe out", "image":
