I'm not livin' in the past\nYou wanna last? Be the first to blast\nRemember Kato, no longer with us, he's deceased\nCall on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets\nNow he rest in peace\nIs there a heaven for a G? Remember me\nSo many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears\n\n[Refrain]\nI suffered through the years\nAnd shed so many tears\nLord\nAnd shed so many tears\nLord, I lost so many peers\nAnd shed so many tears\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means\nLabel me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen\nAnd fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed\nI'm havin' visions of leavin' here in a hearse\nGod, can you feel me?\nStop livin' in the past, you wanna last\nBe first to blast, yeah, uh\n\n[Outro]\nSensical shit\nAyy yo", "image": "https://images.genius.com/19ab47132d55172513fea74b3b39e251.394x394x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
