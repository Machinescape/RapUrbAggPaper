wanna die today, I don't wanna die, I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive, I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die, , [Outro: Khalid], Pain don't hurt the same, I know, The lane I travel feels alone, But I'm moving 'til my legs give out, And I see my tears melt in the snow, But I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna cry anymore, I wanna feel alive, I don't even wanna die anymore, Oh I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't even wanna die anymore\", \"[Hook: Logic], Feeling this villainous vibe, Feeling, feeling this villainous vibe, (Fight!), , [Verse 1: QuEst], Chip on my shoulder, fuck is you sayin' ?, Swear to God our fathers were playing nigga relay the message, Breathless, every morning was forced to skip on breakfast, Mama told me don't let these peasants throw rocks at the king, Pawns tend to carry on with no conscience, Straight non-sense, pay homage or K's vomit, verbal, Fucker wanna know Biggie was making certain while niggas was getting iffy, Heart is bigger than derrières of Vicky and Nicki, But fuck up and diss me, this shit will 360, And must I mention my body count?, It's murderous, to be humble, Murder is to be humble?, Ever heard of me stumble?, I was born in the jungle where niggas belly's will rumble, Get checked for thinking or mumble, But y'all still stuck on rap, Fuck all that, I do this in my slumber, merely ventilation, Tryna stay afloat be on a boat shit, I swear that I'm lost inside of the spirit of Biggie back in his lumberjack, Or Nasir with the fatigue, I felt stifle, street's disciple, My raps are trifle, I shoot slugs for my...you get the picture, I was raised in Miami, niggas'll smack your coofie, Just for acting coochie, your goofy actions'll never move me, No sir, needy no, all my homies is ready to roll, Never the matter the chitter and chatter, I did it 'cause I can machete the flow, And comeback, here's a fun fact, I'm not a dumb act, run that, Little punk rat, fuck it, Pun's back, In the middle of Little Havana, Holding a hammer outside with pajamas, Better watch your grammar around me, These haters surround me, I swear it's unnecessary, Gambino, you childish niggas could never see the shit that I do, VMG, yes nigga VMG, Only competition that we see is TDE, , [Hook: Logic], Feeling this villainous vibe, Feeling, feeling this villainous vibe, , [Interlude: C Dot Castro], Happy birthday to my nigga doe, (Fight!), , [Verse 2: C Dot Castro], I'ma be the guy that rap slow, sike nah, Dictating bitches and smoking Cubans, I'm Castro, My life is like the movie, and I'll be the director, And just to get a small role, got bitches acting extra, I wrote this verse in one minute 'cause Bobby said that he wants rhymes, Intelligent, but I'm getting brain from bitches that's dumb fine, Got punchlines like prom with the, world on my palm, I knew that we would blow up 'cause bitch, we be the bomb, RattPack out to get the cheese, drop a verse, get fifty Gs, Hit the studio drunk as fuck but still drop a verse with ease, I don't give a fuck, Bitch you know the flow is second nature, With no pen and paper break it down disintegrate a hater, wassup, , [Hook: Logic], Feeling this villainous vibe, Feeling, feeling this villainous vibe, (Fight!), , [Verse 3: Jon Bellion], Let's have a money conversation, Four hundred thousand from Eminem that's a payment, Kennedy Reagans presidential arrangement, Please don't let this Pop kid take it back to the basement, I'm still here screaming Beautiful Mind, Sick of the noodles of rhyming all my cubical grind, So I just grew and decided to put you in your spot, Ooodles and boodles of blue bags from Louis Vuitton, Getting money with lawyers we have a Jew of a time, With liquor in a Poland Spring like a Junior at prom, Yes I chose to pop charts I'm doing the crime, And that just means I'm fucking dope to you and your mom, Working in the summer, AC on freezing, Working in the winter like I got no heaters, Spring rolls at the damn four seasons, In the Red Octobers screaming thank you Yeezus, , [Hook: Logic], Feeling this villainous vibe, Feeling, feeling this villainous vibe, (Finish him!), , [Verse 4: Logic], Feeling this villainous vibe, Chilling with me and my Tribe, Gotta spit this to survive, How long have I been alive?, Twenty-four years and counting not including my momma womb, I'm here in the lab, and I'll be here until the tomb, Album coming soon watch the Rattpack consume, Aye, yo, yeah, I've been on that real shit, That fun shit, Spit artillery, like a gunship, V's up we run shit, Don't come around with that dumb shit it's scandalous, In the studio in Los Angeles, At No I.D. spot hit you with the heat rock goddamn, With Bobby on the board everybody on the floor, Hold up let me take a breath here come more, This a freestyle let me redirect my intellect, Drop this shit just for fun, it's all over the internet, 'Cause bitch I'm in effect, Wait hold up, y'all did get the Memo?, You Lumbergh rappers is Initech, Bitch I've been a fact, Hit you like Hiroshima then intercept, Check it yo, See now all the real fans know the album goin be crazy, Spit it off the top and get dirty like Pat Swayze, From the cover of XXL, Fuck around and then propel, Tour coming soon man I know the tickets finna sell, Really, coming for everybody's Achilles, Put my own money into this album, like half a milli, It's Logic, coming for their neck no disrespect, I did this shit in two minutes or less, Spent a year on the album, who knows what to expect (Sinatra), Spent a year on the album, who knows what to expect, This is Logic, , [Bridge: Logic], (Flawless Victory), Happy birthday to me motherfucker, It's my birthday!, , [Hook: Logic], Feeling this villainous vibe, Feeling, feeling this villainous vibe\", '[Intro], \"Wake up, you bitch-ass, Cracker-ass motherfucker, sike, nah\", , [Verse 1: Logic], See all I ever wanted was a window to sit close to, And you don\\'t understand but in the end you ain\\'t supposed to, I\\'m talking first class, 30,000 feet under my ass, Living life on the dash, constant pursuit of cash, Now I\\'m living a life that you and yours could only dream about, And just a couple years ago this shit I used to scheme about, Rehearsing for hours in front of my mirror, Until my voice was hoarse but my vision was clearer, See this that new school style but the flow remind you of them old days, Fast forward to the present, rappers have no class like snow days, Good God, let me bring it back to hip-hops first renaissance, ‘96 Kool-Aid and Sega Genesis, , [Chorus: Logic], \"Hey yo, hey yo, how you keep it so real?, I love the way your lyrics make me feel\", Roll it and get high, light it up and fly, Feeling like I\\'m 30,000 feet up in the sky, I got em\\' saying, \"Hey yo, hey yo, how you keep it so real?, I love the way your lyrics make me feel\", Roll it and get high, light it up and fly, Feeling like I\\'m 30,000 feet up in the sky, , [Interlude: Erykah Badu], I just want a chance to fly, A chance to cry, and a long bye, , [Verse 2: Logic], So many people think that they know my whole situation, Conversations with people that handle public relations, Nothing but hundred dollar bills and standing ovations, Slowly pacing until I kill like that boy Jason, It ain\\'t nothing, never folding or bluffin\\', Get money, fuck bitches but respect women cause we love em\\', Kiss em\\', touch em\\' and rub em\\', Fuck em\\' but never grub em\\', Hit it fast but then I slow it down like Robitussin, Shorty giving me brain until concussion, The club run out of vodka the second we rush in, Never under estimate the power in which I\\'m bustin\\', My lyricism got yo girl blushin\\', Ain\\'t even touch her and yet she gushin\\' (ha), Award shows, chilling with all my bros, Three-piece Ralph Lauren and some Jordans, I suppose, , [Chorus: Logic], \"Hey yo, hey yo, how you keep it so real?, I love the way your lyrics make me feel\", Roll it and get high, light it up and fly, Feeling like I\\'m 30,000 feet up in the sky, I got em\\' saying, \"Hey yo, hey yo, how you keep it so real?, I love the way your lyrics make me feel\", Roll it and get high, light it up and fly, Feeling like I\\'m 30,000 feet up in the sky, , [Outro: Erykah Badu], Out my mind I\\'m tusslin\\', Back and forth \\'tween here and hustlin\\', I don\\'t wanna time travel no mo\\', I wanna be here, my thinkin\\', Say, on this porch I\\'m rockin\\', Back and forth like Lightnin\\' Hopkins, So if anybody speak to Scotty, Tell him, \"Beam me up!\"']\n"
