Do you want to fuck me?\nJust \u2018cause I'm paid in the worst way? True!\nLookin' kinda good in your birthday suit\nI wonder if you're wild and you act shy\nDo you like to be on top or the back side?\nWatch when you lick your lips shake your hips got damn i love that shit, Yo, let's stop fakin', be real now\nI got a room and a hard-on; still down?\nMet you standing at a bar full of black dudes\nSaid you wanna see my scars and my tattoos\nWhen we head for my hideout, act right\nBoss player when I ride out, that's right\nWhat's ya phone number?\n\nLights, camera, action, show-time\nWe bust shit back in no time\nYo kind can't fuck with my kind\nYou must be losin' yo mind\nLights, camera, action, show-time\nWe bust shit back in no time\nYo kind can't fuck with my kind\nYou must be losin' yo mind\n\nOh shit, baby is a dime piece, more than just fine\nShe's personally blessed from the gods\nIf I seen her right now, she could get me hard\nDidn't want to talk to me, just to see my car\nNever had sex with a rich rap star\n'Til I got her in the back of my homeboy's car\nTell me, why do we live this way?\nMoney over bitches, let me hear you say\nWhat's your phone number?\nAre you alone? Got a pocket full of rubbers, let's bone!\nTime for your girlfriend to take you home\nI had fun, but baby, gotta leave me alone\nPicture in my rhyme\nTake time to rewind these words I say\nIf you open your mind bet in a minute you'll find\nIt's time let the Outlawz play\n\nLights, camera, action, show-time\nWe bust shit back in no time\nYo kind can't fuck with my kind\nYou must be losin' yo mind\nLights, camera, action, show-time\nWe bust shit back in no time\nYo kind can't fuck with my kind\nYou must be losin' yo mind\n\nWe still rhime tho\n\nWestside", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dbbdb7f208d5866d896da3ccaf431d59.681x681x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
