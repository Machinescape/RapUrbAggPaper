The nigga Biggie Smalls trying to turn into the black Frank White\nWe had to grow dreads to change our description\nTwo cops is on the milk box missin'\nShow they toes, you know they got stepped on\nA fistful of bullets, a chest full of Teflon\nRunnin' from the police, picture that\nNigga, I'm too fat, I fuck around and catch a asthma attack\nThat's why I bust back, it don't phase me\nWhen he drop, take his Glock, and I'm Swayze\nCelebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight\nLay back, I got some money to make, motherfucker\n\n[Verse 3: Eazy-E]\n\nNow everything's good in my hood, and it's on and poppin'\nEazy-muthaphukkin'-E from east side south Compton\nStraight givin' up the real\nOn how a nigga feel talk that shit, mothafuckers' caps get peeled\nLayin' low in the cut\nGettin' high than a motherfucker - Niggas know what's up\nI'm that gangsta-gangsta, is that what they're still yellin'?\nNigga G to a T saggin' and bailin'\nLive by the gun, you know what I'm sayin', Ren? (Yeah)\nSo I guess I'll die by that motherfucker then\nSo when I die, niggas bury me\nMake sure my shit reads Eazy-muthaphukkin'-E\nAnd it's a fact, to be exact, my tombstone should read\n'He put Compton on that map'\nAnd that's how a nigga feel\nWhen I'm givin' up the motherfuckin' real", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dbbdb7f208d5866d896da3ccaf431d59.681x681x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
