Forever young\n\n[Verse 1: 2Pac]\nBut still I'm having memories of high speed when the cops crashed\nAs I laugh, pushing the gas while my Glocks blast\nWe was young and we was dumb, but we had heart\nIn the dark, will we survive through the bad parts\nMany dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes\nNo hesitation in extermination of these snitches\nEnvious bitches, they still continue to pursue me\nA couple of movies, now the whole world's trying to screw me\nEven the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?\nBut stay true, sipping 22's of brew\nAnd now media is trying to test me\nGot the press asking questions, trying to stress me\nMisery is all I see, that's my mind state\nMy history with the police will shake the crime rate\nMy main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped\nTwo two strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped\n\n[Chorus: Alphaville]\nForever young, I want to be forever young\nDo you really want to live forever, forever and ever?\nForever young, I want to be forever young\nDo you really want to live forever? Forever young\n\n[Verse 2: 2Pac]\nNow, everytime I see you cats is rollin' in packs\nFor the life of me I cannot see why you don't know how to act\nLove to clown when you deep, but when you on that solo creep out on the streets you don't hear a peep\nNigga, it's a God damn shame, somebody explain\nWhy they sent a Bad Boy to play a grown man's game?\nTear that ass out the frame, completely get that ass kicked\nWoke up on the street, but you'll be sleepin' in the casket\nHow long will it last? Nigga, don't ask, just be first to blast\nOutlaw on the mash, tryin' to be the first to see some cash\nMy shit's classic, like my nigga Nate\nGo get the tape, we keep the nation anticipatin' until we break\nMoney made me evil, court cases got me stressed\nNiggas aimin' at my head, but I still wear my vest\nI don't give a fuck, motherfuckers, I'm loc\nThey all duckin' when my gun smoke\nYou ain't shit without your homeboys\n\n[Chorus: Alphaville]\nCan you imagine when this race is won\nTurn our golden faces into the sun\nPraising our leaders, we're getting in tune\nThe music's played by the, the mad men\n\nForever young, I want to be forever young\nDo you really want to live forever, forever and ever?\nForever young, I want to be forever young\nDo you really want to live forever? Forever young\n\n[Verse 3: 2Pac]\nNow, I was born alone, took my first joint and I got high alone\nNow I'm an Outlaw nigga, I never die alone\nMe and my niggas is so close, it's complicated\nOne nigga smokin' and drinkin', and yet we all faded\nMy nigga Edi had a son, we all happy\nCause now that little ridah got to deal with eight daddies\nMy niggas cry, we all cry, and all ride\nTo rectify the problem, motherfuckers, they all die\nBeen tryin' to make a million by hustlin since my adolescence\nFrom crack dealin' to rap villian, my new profession\nWho wanna see me at 8D, fuck 3D\nYou coward ass motherfuckers'll never see me\nBustin' with automatic straps, my raw raps like good crack\nNiggas fiendin', I got 'em comin' back\nUntil I die, they label me as a ridah\nForever, my niggas be together\nAin't shit without your homeboys\n\n[Outro: Alphaville]\nLet's dance in style, let's dance for a while\nHeaven can wait, we're only watching the skies\nHoping for the best but expecting the worst\nAre you gonna drop the bomb or not?\n\nCan you imagine when this race is won\nTurn our golden faces into the sun\nPraising our leaders, we're getting in tune\nThe music's played by the, the mad men\n\nForever young, I want to be forever young\nDo you really want to live forever, forever and ever?\nForever young, I want to be forever young\nDo you really want to live forever?
