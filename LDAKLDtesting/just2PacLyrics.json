I live in Decatur, Georgia\n\nPolice \u2013 How did you get interested in music?\n\n2Pac \u2013 I started off with poetry, with writing poetry\n\nPolice \u2013 Junior High, High School?\n\n2Pac \u2013 Yes, Junior High, High School\n\n2Pac \u2013 And poets I saw when I looked on the Webs*, I did that personally, but then I started turning poetry into songs and I got more attention\n\nPolice \u2013 How did you get into rap?\n\n2Pac \u2013 It\u2019s of my opinion that I was rapping while I was writing poetry..\n\nPolice \u2013 Okay\n\n2Pac \u2013 and so I was into rap, I guess you could say from Junior High, when I wrote my first poems. And after I heard on the radio that there were other poets, who were making records and they were selling and it was working, that\u2019s when I decided to change the method of my poetry\n\nPolice \u2013 How do you define rap? What constitutes rap?\n\n2Pac \u2013 That\u2019s what it is to me: poetry. To me it\u2019s story-telling poetry\n\nPolice \u2013 To music, music with a beat?\n\n2Pac \u2013 With or without music you cannot define rap\n\nPolice \u2013 But it goes, it has sometimes a beat, a tune to it, doesn\u2019t it, even if it hasn\u2019t got accompaniment to it?\n\n2Pac \u2013 No, even a pentameter is rap. It\u2019s how you write it, the structure, it depends how you write it, and as to whether it has a beat, I guess it won\u2019t sell as much if you don\u2019t have a beat; the beat is more of a selling tool\n\nPolice \u2013 Now, you were performing by the time you did your solo-album what people call \u201cgangsta rap\u201d.,\n\n2Pac \u2013 No\n\nPolice \u2013 You were not?\n\n2Pac \u2013 No!\n\nPolice \u2013 What would you call what you were performing?\n\n2Pac \u2013 Rap music!\n\nPolice \u2013 Have you ever performed gangsta rap?\n\n2Pac \u2013 No!\n\nPolice \u2013 Okay, and why would you say that?\n\n2Pac \u2013 Because, Number One, I do not know what \u201cgangsta rap\u201d, is, number two, I would not classify what my music is as gangsta rap\n\nPolice \u2013 Have you heard the term?\n\n2Pac \u2013 A lot!\n\nPolice \u2013 Okay\n\nPolice \u2013 The next statement is a \u201cVictim for Real\u201d : \u201cI really got my ass beat, I really don\u2019t like police\u201d\n\n2Pac \u2013 I didn\u2019t say that.

Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album, resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character of not only Mr Shakur but of Death Row Records as well. Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac's \u2013 excuse me \u2013 Makaveli's verbal assault on Mobb Sleep, Notorious P.I.G., and several other New York rappers. JAY-Z from \"Hawaiian Sophie\" fame, Big Little whatever, and several other corny-sounding motherfuckers are understandably shaken up by this release. The question everybody wants to know is: why'd they get this nigga started? 2Pac \u2013 rather Makaveli \u2013 was not available for comment but released this statement:\n\n[Spoken: 2Pac]\nIt's not about East or West\nIt's about niggas and bitches\nPower and money, ridaz and punks\nWhich side are you on?\n*Heartbeat* *Gunshots*\n*Encroaching footsteps*\nThese niggas is still fuckin' talkin'?\nYou niggas still breathin'?

grave\nIt's like a rope, I hung it 'cause I knew I was dope\nWhile others giggled and joked\nI watched and took notes\nNever surrender, that was my motto as I keep strong\nSecond best for too long, critics I will prove wrong\nOr dissin', no one would listen, they was dissin'\nMy record wouldn't sell they said somethin' was missin'\nClaiming I was radical, 'cause I was true to the streets\nBut did the streets been true to me?\nHow the fuck would I look if I changed?\nActin' strange 'cause I got a little fame\nAin't that a bitch, I was born in a beat down shack\nAin't no turnin' back and now

want the diamonds, want the gold or want the jewelry\nHe don't want the room or want the loot he's in it for the sport\nRunning circles 'round his competition on the court\nHe appreciates your support but he ain't begging for it\nAnd you can love and you can hate it\nBut you can't ignore it, you can't be that ig-nor-ant\nBut you can try to sell him short\nBut you can't fuck with his last joint or the one before it\nAnd he was born to raise hell like them country boys\nAnd If I'm fronting man you better come confront me for it\n\n[Verse 3: Notorious B.I.G.]\nThe pin stripes and the gray

munchies for some soul food\nSo we stopped to get a bite to eat\nAt the local barbecue\nIt's just another boring Monday\nAnd there's nothing else to do\nNow as we stepped out of the car\nI heard someone behind me fighting\nSo I turn to look and find out\nWhat's the cause of this excitement\nOne brother was a dopefiend\nAnd the other was a dopeman\nAnd the dope man had an AK\nSaid he'll spray and he's not jokin'\nWell it seems to be the dopefiend\nOwed the dope man for his product\nAnd he swore if he did not pay\nHe would end up getting shot up\nNow I could not walk away\nCause I got caught up in the scene\nWondering what would happen to this\nPoor and helpless fiend\nWell my homie, Michael Cooley\nSaid let's go and make our order\nWhat's the use in watchin' two men\nStand out here fight over quarters\nWhile I walked inside the diner\nAnd all the Dope Fiends waved to me\nHeard the sound of several gun shots\nAnd I ran outside to see...\n\nAll the people in the diner\nRan outside to see the big show\nIt was just another party\nFor them to see just who they would know\nBut for me I held concern\nI wanted to go see the outcome\nWould the mother have her son tonight\nOr would she live her life without one?\nI made it to the streets I\nAlmost cried right on the spot\nNot only had the fiend died\nBut a small girl had been shot\nAnd my heart could take no more\nI felt a tear roll down my face\nThat was daddy's bullet\nBut she took it in his place\n\nI tried to make my way through the crowd\nSo I could go help the baby\nShe could barely speak\nBut she whispered\nMister can you please save me\nSo I screamed out, someone help me\nBut I dont think they could hear\nAnd if they did, they didn't care\nOh how I hated everyone there\nThe baby lie here dying\nAnd I wondered what could I do\nThe camera men and newspapers had come\nTo get their interviews\nTo them it's just a story\nAnd they can't see the tragedy\nTo them it doesn't matter\nCause it ain't, it wasn't their family\nI don't think I'll be back\nCause it'll never be the same here\nSo I wipe away the tears\nAnd leave the scene the way I came here\nThough some people say it's crazy\nAnd the food could have been finer\nI'll never forget, never forget the night\nAt Dopefiend's Diner\n\n[Outro]\nDo, do, do, do, do, do, do, do...[Chorus: Carl Thomas]\nWho you are\nOne nation under a thug

She was pregnant with Tupac while in jail and on trial as one of the Infamous New York 21. This was a time where all the members of the party were accused of conspiracy to bomb public places. Afeni Shakur was eventually acquitted of all charges. Tupac's aunt Assata Shakur was also a member of the Black Panther Party. She was accused of killing a New Jersey state trooper. She eventually fled the country in exile. Today she still lives in Cuba. Tupac described his mom as a strong-willed woman who handled her business. His real father was unknown. As a youth, he identified with a pimp and petty hustler named \"Legs\" who later died from a crack-induced heart attack. Tupac was described as an energetic child who always liked to imagine himself in the lead role. His mom saw fit to enroll him at age 12 in the 127 Street Ensemble, which was a theatre group in Harlem, New York. Tupac\u2019s first acting role was the character, Travis, in the play Raisin in the Sun. Tupac did not involve himself with rap until he and his family moved to Baltimore. As a young teenager, he took on the name \"MC New York.\" While living in Baltimore, Tupac continued his acting by auditioning and later being accepted in Baltimore's Prestigious School for the Arts. At age 17, Tupac moved with his mom to Marin City in the San Francisco Bay area. It was in Marin City that Tupac lived about street life. In an attempt to be accepted and fit in with his peers, Tupac became a petty hustler who sold drugs. It was in Marin City that Tupac rediscovered rap. He ingratiated himself in the Bay Area's emerging rap scene by joining a group called Strictly Dope. This group featured fellow Bay Area rap star Ray Luv. While a member of Strictly Dope, Tupac decided to branch out and he eventually became friends with Digital Underground\u2019s lead rapper, Shock G. Tupac auditioned for the group and he eventually became part of the group first as a roadie and later as a dancer. He went on to be a hype man for the group Digital Underground. As a member of Digital Underground, Tupac became known as \"the rebel of the underground.\" Much of this had to do with his excitable and unpredictable personality. Tupac's tendency to stir up things had lead to many of his successes, as well as many of his troubles.\n\n(Troubles, troubles, troubles, troubles...)Hahhahahha\n(well I ain't do nuttin', well I ain't do nuttin')\nGet him, shoot that nigga {\u200b\u200bgun shot}\u200b\u200b huh\nIt's on son hahaha (it's on) niggas gon' {\u200b\u200bgun shot}\u200b\u200b huh\nCan you feel it, we gon' {\u200b\u200bgun shot}\u200b\u200b huh\nOaktown in the house\nNiggas goin' {\u200b\u200bgun shot}\u200b\u200b huh (that nigga gotta gun)\nRicky Town in the house\nMotherfuckers goin' {\u200b\u200bgun shot}\u200b\u200b huh\nSouth Central's in the house\nMotherfuckers goin' {\u200b\u200bgun shot}\u200b\u200b huh\nHouston, Texas can you feel me (watch out!) go  {\u200b\u200bgun shot}\u200b\u200b huh\nSpringfield, Queens in the house\nMotherfuckers goin' (boomyah) {\u200b\u200bgun shot}\u200b\u200b huh\nYoung gunz in the motherfuckin' house let me ya hear ya go (boomyah) {\u200b\u200bgun shot}\u200b\u200b huh\nCan ya feel it motherfuckers go {\u200b\u200bgun shot}\u200b\u200b huh\nThug life, thug life we goin' {\u200b\u200bgun shot}\u200b\u200b huh\nMack 10 go {\u200b\u200bgun shot}\u200b\u200b huh\nRated R in the motherfuckin' house look out, look out {\u200b\u200bgun shot}\u200b\u200b\n[?] {\u200b\u200bgun shot}\u200b\u200b huh\n[?] get 'em {gun shot} huh\nD-Lo smoke 'em {\u200b\u200bgun shot}\u200b\u200b huh\nSergio uh get down nigga {\u200b\u200bgun shot}\u200b\u200b huh\nBig Syke in the motherfuckin' house go {\u200b\u200bgun shot}\u200b\u200b huh\nLil' Corey grow strong nigga and go {\u200b\u200bgun shot}\u200b\u200b huh\nMadman in the motherfucker {\u200b\u200bgun shot}\u200b\u200b huh\n[?] in the motherfuckin' house go {\u200b\u200bgun shot}\u200b\u200b huh\nFeel me! {\u200b\u200bgun shot}\u200b\u200b huh\nBay's in this motherfucker {\u200b\u200bgun shot}\u200b\u200b huh\nBig Stretch in the motherfuckin' house (boomyah) {\u200b\u200bgun shot}\u200b\u200b huh\nK-Lo (look out look out) in the motherfuckin' house {\u200b\u200bgun shot}\u200b\u200b huh\nMadness you Bad Boy huh why enemy I'm comin', I'm comin', I'm comin' ah ah they goin' {\u200b\u200bgun shot}\u200b\u200b\nI need a gangsta bitch 'less they kept it go {\u200b\u200bgun shot}\u200b\u200b huh\nCan you feel it? boo yaaaa they go {\u200b\u200bgun shot}\u200b\u200b\nAyo fuck the police we goin' {\u200b\u200bgun shot}\u200b\u200b\nIn 93 you find 'em dead {\u200b\u200bgun shot}\u200b\u200b huh\nTwo shots in the head, (is that a cop) hear me?

she witnessed baby boy rip a crowd\nWent to school, but I dropped out and left the house\n\u2018Cause my mama say I'm good for nothin', so I'm out\nSince I only got one life to live, God forgive me for my sins\nLet me make it and I'll never steal again or deal again\nMy only friend is my misery\nWantin' revenge for the agony they did to me\nSee, my life ain't promised, but it's sure gettin' better\nHope you understand my love letter, to my unborn child\n\n[Hook: Natasha Walker]\nI'm writing you a letter\nThis is to my unborn child\nWanna let you know I love you\nIf you didn't know I feel

make it on my own, not a handout\nMake way for a whirlwind prophesized\nI wanna go in peace when I gotta die\nOn these cold streets, ain't no love, no mercy and no friends\nIn case you never see my

Just as that drama was beginning to be sorted out, he was arrested in New York the following month and accused of sexually assaulting a female fan in his hotel room. In the backdrop of that controversy, Tupac managed to release another album entitled Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z., which featured the smash hits \"I Get Around\" and it's emotional tribute to women, \"Keep Your Head Up.\" During this time, Tupac was featured in two more movies. The first was Poetic Justice with Janet Jackson. Here he stirred things up again on the set by refusing to honor Miss Jackson's request to take an AIDS test.

the parkin' lot for a little romance\nGot to my car, put the key in the ignition\nTurned on the slow jams, I was on a mission\nI was catchin' wild things like the chicken pox\nI was \"J\" and knockin' boots right down the socks\nShe was freaky and wild, oh man could I call it?\nBut when I dropped her off, she had stole my wallet\nI couldn't quite believe that why a hoocher-coocher?\nBut that was my first experience with MINNIE THE MOOCHER!!\n\n[2Pac]\nMinnie the Moocher was a legend on the block I'm from\nA dream girl to many brothers, but true to none\nHer reputation was enormous - a real go getter\nAnd once a brother met her, he wanted to get with her\nMaybe it was her smile, her personality or\nThe way she shook her shimmy or the clothes she wore\nBut whatever it was, Minnie the Moocher was an expert\nReal heart-breaker, but never get hurt\nShe had this boyfriend, his name was Diamond\nHelpin' Minnie out with the little social climbin'\nMet with Politicians, peace to many others\nSuddenly and instantly, they became her lovers\nShe took the power that they possessed\nAnd Minnie did it all without gettin' undressed\nMinnie dissed Diamond sayin' that he could not live with her\nBut he wanted payment for the things he did for her\nHe grabbed the gun sittin' on the nightstand\nMinnie held the bullets, put the pistol in her right hand\nShe was a legend to everyone who knew her\nThat's is my memory of Minnie the Moocher\n\n[Ray Tyson]\nMinnie had a boyfriend, a gambler\nAddicted to poker, an alcoholic, a basshead, crack smoker\nHe took her to Harlem, and all around Chinatown\nHe bought some bass, a pipe a tape of hard-rap sounds\nShe was an addict, tired of the static and poverty\nSick of the same ghetto misery\nSee, Minnie was a young kid lookin' for excitement\nSmokey was a hoodlum, headin' for inditement\nThen one day their relationship stopped\nWhen Smokey was killed by the M-I-C-Cops\nMinnie was hurt, lost without a clue\nTo her, there was no chance of gettin' somebody new\nSo she walked home sadly, as bad as it seems\nShe cried herself to sleep to find the man of her dreams\n\n[Ray Tyson]\nShe had dreams and schemes about the King of Sweden\nHe gave her things that this girl was much needin'\nA plush house made of gold and steel\nA diamond car with a platt in the wheel\nNow you might think this is a lot of stuff\nBut to Minnie this was not enough\nHe bought a stable, full of thorough-bred race horses\nHis meal she ate was a dozen courses\nShe had a fortune in nickels and dimes\nAnd she sat around and counted it a billion times\nShe had bank, yeah Minnie was clockin'\nHad every sucker in the neighborhood JOCKIN'!!\nShe would walk by tryin' all to wink her eye\nThen she dissin', with zero reply* Poems written by Shakur

heartless breath, the underlying cause of my arrest\nMy life is stressed, and no rest forever weary\nMy eyes stay teary for all the brothers that are buried in the cemetery\nShit's scary, our black on black crime legendary\nBut at times unnecessary, I'm gettin worried\nTeardrops and closed caskets, the three strikes law is drastic\nAnd certain death for us ghetto bastards\nWhat can we do when we're arrested, but open fire\nLife in the pen ain't for me, cause I'd rather die\nBut don't cry through your despair\nI wonder if the Lord still cares, for us niggas on welfare\nAnd who cares if we survive\nThe only time they notice a nigga is when he clutchin on a four-five\nMy neighborhood ain't the same\nCause all the little babies goin crazy and they sufferin in the game\nAnd I swear it's like a trap\nBut I ain't given up on the hood it's all good when I go back\nHoes show me love, niggas give me props\nForever hop cause it don't stop... on my block\n\n[Richie Rich & 2-Pac mini

jail but crack sales got me livin well\nIn a sense I'm suicidal with this Thug's Life\nStayin strapped, forever trapped in this drug life\nGod help me, cause I'm starvin, can't get a job\nSo I resort to violent robbings, my life is hard\nCan't sleep cause all the dirt make my heart hurt\nPut in work and shed tears for my dead peers\nMisled from childhood where I went astray\nTill this day I still pray for a better way\nCan't help but feel hopeless and heartbroke\nFrom the start I felt the racism cause I'm dark\nCouldn't quit, the bullshit make me represent\nHit the bar and played the star, everywhere I went\nIn my heart, I felt alone out here on my own\nI close my eyes and picture home... on my block\n\n[Richie Rich & 2-Pac mini skit once again]\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd I can't help but wonder why\nSo many young kids had to die\nCaught strays from AK's in a drive-by\nSwollen pride and homicide, don't coincide\nBrothers cry for broken lives, mama come inside\nCause our block is filled with danger\nUsed to be a close knit community but now we're all cold strangers\nTime changes us to stone, them crack pipes\nAll up and down the block exterminatin black life\nBut I can't blame the dealers\nMy mama's welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels\nShit's real, I know ya feel, my tragedy\nA single mother with a problem child, daddy free\nHangin out pickin up game, sippin cheap liquor\nGamin the hoochies hopin I can get to sleep with her\nIt's a man's world, stayin strapped\nFantasies of a nigga livin phat, but held back\nPipe dreams can make the night seem hopeless\nWide eyed and losin focus... on my block\n\n[Richie Rich & 2-Pac skit once again]\n\n[Verse 4]\nAnd block parties in the projects lastin way past daylight\nA young nigga learned to break night\nUsed to play fight with my homies but they stuck in the pen\nI send them ends, but it's tough on a friend, in my mind\nI see the same motherfuckers ballin\nAlcohol will make a lazy nigga slip and fall, misses call\nI know the young niggas understand this\nGrowing up in this world where everything is scandalous\nI reminisce on tha fast times, past crimes\nTryin to cop a slice of pizza with my last dime\nCan't explain, just what attracts me to this dirty game\nGold chains, some extra change, and the street fame\nAnd what's strange is that everybody knows my name, swear they all know me\nAnd lots of cash make a nigga change\nI hit the green just to maintain, feelin pain\nFor all the niggas that I lost to the game... from my block\n\n[Outro with Richie Rich vocals]\nRest in peace

or raised too high to fight for Yusef\nCan't blame 'em, they slumber, come here ya Casanova\nJust because Mandela is free don't mean the freedom fight is over\nThe beaches, Howard, Virginia and the others\nYa let 'em lynch the brothers and no one will love the mothers\n\"Confused?\"\nYou shouldn't be, my facts are stated clearly\nBut my raps contain no \"wild thing\" so I guess no one will hear me\n\"They're killin' us?\"\nBut what's new, cause nobody will yell out\nThey're all too busy livin' lavish lives of a sellout\n\"The police?\"\nA big joke, the only time their gun smokes\nIs when they murder brothers after every bone has been broke\n\"Huey?\"\nA hero, although he never tried to be\nDied and since his death he's still a victim of society\n\"Well, what's next?\"\nUnity, respect and love your sisters\nWe joke and call 'em bitches so the crackers try to diss her\n\"We'll kill them?\"\nThat's not the way, it's time to use intelligence\n\"Turn the other cheek?\"\nNever again, it's time for self-defense\n\"How come you're so angry?\"\nCause I'm tired of bein' kept down\nNow it's time to wipe away the tears of a clown\n\n[Intermission]\n\n[Verse 2]\n\"Why ya cryin'?\"\nI told ya, I'm tired of livin' life low\nThe rich can beat the lotto, while the poor stay in the ghetto\n\"The president?\"\nElected, but I don't know how it happened\nBetter qualified for rappin', with his gift for senseless yakkin'\nA day for Martin Luther King, now his soul is put to rest\nTurnin' over in the grave next to him is Malcolm X\nForgotten too quickly, it makes me want to hate them\nForgot about his wisdom, he's the latest fashion statement\n\"Red or Blue, what set ya claim?\"\nDoes it make a difference?\nOne day we're gonna work it out and overcome this ignorance\n\"Education?\"\nPropaganda, taught to me in class\nHow can we control our future if we're kept from our past?\nWe better live a better way or we won't see another day\nYou can heed the words I say or don't and kiss your life away\nNot tryin' to preach or teach, it is my wish to only explain\nSo many died before me, can I let their lives be in vain?\nSo now we've come to this point, it's time to make decision\nDo we live in self-destruction or escape the realism?\nThey ask me why I'm angry, cause I'm tired of bein' kept down\nMy people, let's unite and wipe away the tears of a clown\n\n[Intermission]\n\n[Verse 3]\n\"What ills the children\"\nThe future, for them, I see such sorrow\nThe least that we can do is let them live to see tomorrow\nToo many have been killed, it's time to stand up for our rights\nHow can the people \"Fight The Power\", if they can't fight for their life?\nInstead, they fight their wife, beat up if she's not silent\nTime to fight for principles, the brothers get nonviolent\nThe government is so crooked and liberties a hypocrite\n\"The Star Spangled Banner?\"\nJust some patriotic bullshit\nDestruction of the Panthers another sneak attack plan\nCouldn't stand to see the strength and peace within the Blackman\n\"Where are all the heroes who we thought were so untouchable?\"\nI see 'em pushin' dope and rollin' 'round in BMW\nHow can it not trouble you to see a dyin' species?\nThe world must find peace or find itself ripped up in pieces\nAfflicted with the teaching's, that make ya feel inferior\nSome say the government invents it all, that they just scarier\nPolly want a cracker, but cracker want a sister\nHow come they could see her beauty, but brothers persist to diss her?\nRevolutionary generation on an uprise\nNever will they see another tear from this clown's eye\n\n[Intermission]\n\n[Verse 4]\nLivin' the life I live, I have to be positive\nHell's my reality, I chose not to ride in it\nI did want to live fast, I just wanted much cash\nBut punks were persistent, they hunted with gauge blast\nSo I wasn't the violent type, I had to protect my life\nLovin' my brother, but if he steps, I'mma shoot him twice\n\n(song cut)\n\nPsychotic society\nIt's hard to find love with those who treat us like enemy\nThey call me a lunatic, I say realistic\nBeware of their politics, it's sick as the sick get\nThe son of a Panther, see pain in my mama's eyes\nCause nobody thanked her for givin' them better lives\n\"Assata Shakur?\"\nAnother auntie, I miss her though\nPlease thank Mr. Castro for keepin' her safe bro\nHow many more of us die before we can see the light\nIt's time brothers work it out, unite for a bigger fight\nWe're still in the same hole and now it's the 90's\nSeems everyone's livin' large, but I ain't got mine G\nBut I got a bill for all the ill ya gave me\nSociety slavery, who's gonna pay me?\n\"Has anybody here seen Yusef Hawkins?\"\nI thought I seen him talkin' with Malcolm walkin'\n\"Where, over the rainbow\"?\nNaw, over the track\nAnother murdered brother, now where's the payback\nTears of a clown\n\n[Intermission]          \n            Lyrics for this song have yet

He resisted and was shot five times. Left for dead, Tupac shocked the world by not only surviving, but checking out the hospital just days after the incident. Tupac was in New York filming a video as well as awaiting the fate of his trial for the sexual assault charges he was indicted for the year before. He would eventually be sentenced to four and a half years in prison. He would also accuse former rap partner Notorious B.I.G. as the person who set him up to be shot. It was these accusations that intensified the supposed East/West Coast rivalry within hip hop. Now just before Tupac began serving his sentence for sexual assault charges, he released his third album entitled Me Against The World. It was on this album the world heard Tupac's tribute to his mom entitled \"Dear Mama.\" After serving a little more than seven months in New York's correctional facilities, Tupac was released on 1.3 million dollars bail and signed to Death Row Records, the home to Snoop Dogg and Tha Dogg Pound. He quickly made noise with the release of his hit song \"California Love,\" a track featuring himself and Dr. Dre. While awaiting his appeal, Tupac released the double album All Eyez On Me. It featured all sorts of artists, ranging from R&B crooner Jodeci to Baby Area locals like Dru Down and Richie Rich. Ironically while out on bail, Tupac had managed to again embroil himself in controversy. He was arrested twice for parole violations and accused of causing a disturbance that took place at the Soul Train Music Awards. Reports confirmed that he confronted Notorious B.I.G. backstage. On September 7th, 1996, 2Pac and CEO of Death Row Suge Knight left the Mike Tyson-Bruce Seldon fight in Las Vegas in Suge's car. A white Cadillac with four people inside pulled alongside at an intersection, and on person stepped out and opened fire. Tupac was hit four times while Suge escaped with minor injuries. Tupac was brought to the University Medical Center. On Friday, September 13, 1996, Tupac died after six days in critical condition. Tupac Shakur was pronounced dead at 4:03 PM. His body was later cremated. He was only 25.\n\n(He was only 25, he was only 25, he was only 25, he was only 25, he was only 25, he was only 25, he was only 25, he was only 25, he was only 25, he was only 25...)\n\n[Piano Instrumental]Introduced with innocence\nwho would have ever guessed\nThat u were the one I had\nBeen so desperately searching 4\nu Talk as I do but yet u don't\nunderstand when I mumble\nu c as I do but your vision is\nblurred by naivete\nThis is the barrier that separates us\nI cannot cross yet\nThere is 2 much of me that\nwould frighten u so I live in\nheartache because we cannot\nfully explore this love and\nwhat of your heartache\nDoes it feel as sharp as mine\nNo matter where I go or how long it takes\nI will never recover from this mutual heartache.[2Pac talking]\nWest Side (You punk muthafuckaz) UNmuthafuckinTouchables\n(What's up nigga) With the L.B.C. clique nigga (gang)\nBad boy killa, untouchable\n(Hehe, you know what time it is)\nPut your guns down nigga, (West Side) we UNmuthafuckinTouchable (Gang)\nDie, West Side, outlaw, thuglife, M.O. muthafuckin B\nL.B. muthafuckin C\nWhat it be like, what it see like\n(You know)\n\n[Verse 1: 2Pac]\nHuh\nSmooth criminal, individual suffer\nWent to jail, made bail, seein' hell, made me rougher, gettin' money\nFunny it seems, young black teens\nTriple beam dreams make 'em, fiend for crack scenes\nMaybe I'll fuckin' make a million\nBustin' from on top of the buildin'\nA victim addicted to killin'\nI can see it in my eye sight\nYo what's the Hassa?\nIt's a pig that don't fly right, you die tonight\nGet me high I'm a killa, lyrics raise drug dealers\nTurn 'em to muthafuckin' thug niggas\nL.B.C. come and bare with me\nHang with the same niggas go to jail with me\nBang, with the Outlaw clique\nSick since I came out\nPull out my pistol, aim blow your brains out\nPull it, my every word like a bullet\nHollow point style, murder niggas 'til they feel it\nI'm untouchable\n\n[Verse 2: Bad Azz]\nI'm that bottom rock, thinkin' 'bout no limitation\nOn comin' up, (hehe) dealin' wit' anybody runnin' up\nThey get the gat smack, cracks how my gun goes\nHoles in your body and blood all over your clothes\n'Cause money makes earth, what it's worth, gettin' hurt\nDoin' dirt to stay spendin', you can borrow, I mean it\nAny, all confrontation on the currency\nHere in '96, fine chips, stackin' while I'm mackin' no mo'\nIt's L.B.C. and it's a no no\nTalkin' what you don't know and won't know\nHeat hold me down, while I keeps holdin' it down\n'Cause I'm quick to rush and what\nNigga we bust 'em up\nCock it back, ready to blow your block off the map\nThug Life niggas ride wit us\nCops tryin' to get us but they can't\nWe untouchable\n\n(gang gang gang)\n\n[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]\nHmm\nWhen you're in the fast lane havin' money and fame\nYou got to, always, check, the game\nLook here mane, maintain\n'Cause this game is a cold thing\nCan you dig it mane?\nFo sho' mane, I wish I had your game\nLook here young dog, do your own thing\nThem bitch ass niggas in your clique, buck 'em no\nStay real with yourself and untouchable\nSee that's what's wrong with you niggas now\nBut uh, me and my dawgs from the Thug Pound\nWe just paper chasin', we know nay-thing\nAre you relatin' to the shit we creatin'?\n\n[Verse 4: E.D.I.

Nigel and Trevor took me to Nell's. When we got there, I was immediately impressed, because it was different than any club I'd been in. It wasn't crowded, there was lots of space, there were beautiful women there. I was meeting Ronnie Lott from the New York Jets and Derrick Coleman from the Nets. They were coming up to me, like, \"Pac, we're proud of you.\" I felt so tall that night, because they were people's heroes and they saying I was their hero. I felt above and beyond, like I was glowing.\n\nSomebody introduced me to this girl. And the only thing I noticed about her: She had a big chest. But she was not attractive; she looked dumpy, like. Money came to me and said, \"This girl wants to do more than meet you.\" I already knew what that meant: She wanted to fuck. I just left them and went to the dance floor by myself. They were playing some Jamaican music, and I'm just grooving.\n\nThen this girl came out and started dancing-and the shit that was weird, she didn't even come to me face-first, she came ass-first. So I'm dancing to this reggae music; you know how sensuous that is. She's touching my dick, she's touching my balls, she opened my zipper, she put her hands on me. There's a little dark part in Nell's, and I see people over there making out already, so she starts pushing me this way. I know what time it is.\n\nWe go over in the corner. She's touching me. I lift up my shirt while I'm dancing, showing off my tattoos and everything. She starts kissing my stomach, kissing my chest, licking me and shit. She's going down, and I'm, like, Oh shit. She pulled my dick out; she started sucking my dick on the dance floor. That shit turned me on. I wasn't thinking, like, This is going to be a rape case. I'm thinking, like, This is going to be a good night. You know what I'm saying?\n\nSoon as she finished that-just enough to get me solid, rock-hard-we got off the dance floor. I told Nigel, \"I've got to get out of here. I'm about to take her to the hotel. I'll see you all later.\" Nigel was, like, \"No, no, no. I'm going to take you back.\" We drive to the hotel. We go upstairs and have sex, real quick. As soon as I came, that was it. I was tired, I was drunk, I knew I had to get up early in the morning, so I was, like, \"What are you going to do? You can spend the night or you can leave.\" She left me her number, and everything was cool. Nigel was spending the night in my room all these nights. When he found out she sucked my dick on the floor and we had sex, he and Trevor were livid! Trevor is a big freak; he was going crazy. All he kept asking me was, \"D-d-did you fuck in the ass?\" He was listening to every single detail. I thought, This is just some guy shit, it's all good.\n\nWe had a show to do in New Jersey at Club 88. This dude said, \"I'll be there with a limo to pick you up at midnight.\" We went shopping, we got dressed up, we were all ready. Nigel was saying, \"Why don't you give her a call?\" So we were all sitting in the hotel, drinking. I'm waiting for the show, and Nigel's, like, \"I called her. I mean, she called me, and she's on her way.\" But I wasn't thinking about her no second time. We were watching TV when the phone rings, and she's downstairs. Nigel gave Man-man, my manager, some money to pay for the cab, and I was, like, \"Let that b*tch pay for her own cab.\" She came upstairs looking all nice, dressed all provocative and shit, like she was ready for a prom date.\n\nSo we're all sitting there talking, and she's making me uncomfortable, because instead of sitting with Nigel and them, she's sitting on the arm of my chair. And Nigel and Trevor are looking at her like a chicken, like she's, like, food. It's a real uncomfortable situation. So I'm thinking, Okay, I'm going to take her to the room and get a massage. I'm thinking about being with her that night at Nell's. So we get in the room, I'm laying on my stomach, she's massaging my back. I turn around. She starts massaging my front. This lasted for about a half an hour. In between, we would stop and kiss each other. I'm thinking she's about to give me another blow job. But before she could do that, some niggas came in, and I froze up more than she froze up. If she would have said anything, I would have said, \"Hold on, let me finish.\" But I can't say nothing, because she's not saying nothing. How do I look saying, \"Hold on\"? That would be like I'm making her my girl.\n\nSo they came and they started touching her a**. They going, \"Oooh, she's got a nice ass.\" Nigel isn't touching her, but I can hear his voice leading it, like, \"Put her panties down, put her pantyhose down.\" I just got up and walked out the room.\n\nWhen I went to the other suite, Man-man told me that Talibah, my publicist at the time, had been there for a while and was waiting in the bedroom of that suite. I went to see Talibah and we talked about what she had been doing during the day, then I went and laid down on the couch and went to sleep. When I woke up, Nigel was standing over me going, \"Pac, Pac,\" and all the lights was on in both rooms. The whole mood had changed, you know what I'm saying? I felt like I was drugged. I didn't know how much time had passed. So when I woke up, it was, like, \"You're going to the police, you're going to the police.\" Nigel walks out the room, comes back with the girl. Her clothes is on; ain't nothing tore. She just upset, crying hysterically. \"Why you let them do this to me?\" She's not making sense. \"I came to see you. You let them do this to me.\" I'm, like, \"I don't got time for this shit right here. You got to chill out with that shit. Stop yelling at me and looking at me all crazy.\" She said, \"This not the last time you're going to hear from me,\" and slammed the door. And Nigel goes, \"Don't worry about it, Pac, don't worry. I'll handle it. She just tripping.\" I asked him what happened, and he was, like, \"Too many niggas.\" You know, I ain't even tripping no more, you know? niggas start going downstairs, but nobody was coming back upstairs. I'm sitting upstairs smoking weed, like, Where the fuck is everybody at? Then I get a call from Talibah from the lobby saying, \"The police is down here.\"\n\n\nNever did nothing. Only thing I saw was all three of them in there and that nigga talking about how fat her ass was. I got up, because the nigga sounded sick. I don't know if she's with these niggas, or if she's mad at me for not protecting her. But I know I feel ashamed-because I wanted to be accepted and because I didn't want no harm done to me-I didn't say nothing.{Gunshot}\n[Man talking]\nYo, Red Spyda (ooh-wee) is that 50 Cent/Pac joint ready?\n{Gun cocking} Let me know, holla {Gunshot}\n\n[2Pac - from the song \"Smile\"]\nThere's gon' be some stuff you gon' see\nThat's gon' make it hard to smile in the future\n\n[50 Cent talking]\nYeah nigga!

Y'all seen 2Pac man?\nThere he go! Ay 'Pac!\"Davey D: In 1991, Tupac got his first real taste of trouble when he was stopped for jay walking in downtown Oakland. According to Pac, the police officers did not take a liking to his name, for they said some unfavorable things. Pac in return responded and the result was him being arrested and brutalized. This incident resulted  in him filing a 10 million dollar lawsuit against the City of Oakland. It wasn't long afterwards that Tupac released the first of his six albums. The first was entitled 2Pocalypse Now and it highlighted Tupac\u2019s passionate, political, and thug life side. Songs like \"Trap\" while politically on point, stirred up much of the controversy when it depicted an Oakland police officer being shot at the end of the video. This particular song caught the attention of Dan Quayle, who expressed his outrage. Other songs like \"Brenda Got a Bay\" brought attention to the emotional and heartfelt side of the rising star. Tupac gained national fame when he played the role of Roland Bishop, a violent, insecure, short-tempered, psychotic individual, and the blockbuster movie Juice. Initially, director Ernest Dickerson had invited Digitial Underground's Money B to audition for the movie. Tupac went along for the ride. Once there, he read the part cold turkey and was hired to play his role, which left many wondering if Tupac was acting or just being himself. As Tupac's popularity began to soar, so did his troubles. In the Summer of \u201992 while attending Marine City's 50th Anniversary, Tupac and his entourage had a confrontation with some old acquaintances. During the ensuing fight, a gun was drawn, shots were fired, and a little six-year-old laid dead as an innocent bystander. Tupac's brother Mercedes, who at the time rapped for the group Tony! Toni! Ton\u00e9! and later for Thug Life, was arrested and charged. Eventually he was let go for lack of evidence. Tupac later found himself embroiled in more controversy when a Texas cop was shot and killed. The widow of the slain officer filed the multi-million dollar civil suit against Tupac, claiming that it was his music and lyrics that influenced the young perpetrator to kill. If that wasn't enough, also in that year, Tupac while visiting the set of Fox TV's In Living Color had an altercation with the limo driver. The result was him being arrested and charged with assault. Eventually the charges would drop. Seemingly wherever Tupac went, trouble followed. First Tupac found himself being charged with assault after he and a group of friends beat up the film directors known as the Hughes Brothers. This incident stemmed from him being fired from the movie Menace II Society.\n\n(-Ciety, -ciety, -ciety, -ciety)[Verse 1]\nBorn to wreck shit, poppin' bubble gum\nOthers call me Yum, but momma call me troublesome\nLearned to shoot a gun, before I learned to read or write\nNever touched a pipe, made my money every night\n'Til I gotta (ride), a motherfuckin' Benz (benz)\nBitch talked to every snitch, they jeopardized me gettin' rich\nOnly fifteen at a spot full of rock teens\nFull of hard knocks, ready to clock, fuck the cops (yeah!)\nAnd we was fat like Trump\nEvery nigga packed a pump, so time to be poppin' trunks\nI stood at the top of the organization\nReady to pop a cop with no hesitations (fuck the police) yeah\nNow I'm makin' all the others run\nCause here it comes, look out for brother troublesome\n\n[Interlude]\nYeah y'all, hehe\nA nigga named Troublesome\n\n[Verse 2]\nI learned from my mistakes I'm twenty-one now\nI gotta pack of jackers out for me they hold a gun battle\nAin't old enough to save but I behave just like a true vet\nThat's cause for all the dirt I did and dirt I didn't do yet\nTryin' to pop my pistol for a profit\nCopper tried to stop I didn't drop and so we got it (yeah)\nAnd I don't give a fuck about it\n(Aiyyo you think you'll ever quit this shit?)

born without a silver spoon\nMy broken down TV show cartoons in my living room (hey)\nOne day I hope to make it, a player in this game\nMama, don't cry, long as we try maybe things change\nPerhaps it's just a fantasy\nA life where we don\u2019t need no welfare and share with our whole family\nMaybe it's me that caused it, the fightin' and the hurtin'\nIn my room cryin' because I didn't wanna be a burden\nWatch Mama open up her arms to hug me\nAnd I ain't worried 'bout a damn thing, with unconditional love\n\n[Chorus]\nIn this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see\nThough things change, the

friend to me\nWhere would I be without my dogs?\nNo wonder why when times get hard\n'Cause it ain't easy bein' who we are\nDriven by my ambitions, desire higher positions\nSo I proceed to make G's eternally\nAnd my mission is to be more than just a rap musician\nThe elevation of today's generation, if I could make 'em listen\nPrison ain't what we need, no longer stuck in greed\nTime to plan, strategize, my family's gotta eat\nWe work somethin' out of nothin'\nNo pleasure in the sufferin'\nNeighborhood would be good if they could cut out all the bustin'\nThe liquor and the weed, the cussin'\nSendin' love out to my block\nThe struggle never stops (unconditional love)\n\n[Chorus]\nIn this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see\nThough things change, the future's still inside of me\nWe must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark\nSo you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love\nIn this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see\nThough things change, the future's still inside of me\nWe must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark\nSo you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'll probably never understand your ways\nWith everyday I swear I hear you tryin' to change your ways\nWhile gettin' paid at the same time\nJust had a baby with the same eyes\nSomethin' inside, please let me die, these are strange times\nHow come I never made it?\nMaybe it's the way I played it in my heart\nI knew one day I gotta be a star\nMy hopes and all my wishes, so many vivid pictures\nAnd all the currency I'll never even get to see\nThis fast life soon shatters, 'cause after all the lights and screams nothin' but my dreams matter\nHopin' for better days, maybe a peaceful night\nBaby, don't cry, 'cause everything gon' be alright\nJust lay your head on my shoulder\nDon't worry 'bout a thing, baby girl, I'm a soldier (huh)\nNever treated me bad, no matter who I was\nYou still came with that unconditional love\n\n[Chorus] (repeat to fade)\nIn this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see\nThough things change, the future's still inside of me\nWe must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark\nSo you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love\nIn this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see\nThough things change, the future's still inside of me\nWe must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark\nSo you will always be in my heart, with unconditional loveMy child is out there somewhere\nunder the skies above\nwaiting anxiously 4 u and me\n2 bless it with our love\nA part of me a part

once I found her I would charm her and\nAnd she'd be mine forever (mine forever)\nI found her and, indeed she is all that I, wished for and more but she\nIs not charmed nor intrigued (not charmed, nor intrigued)\nThen I think to myself what.. can I offer her\nThe tears warm my eyes and blur my, vision I\nStick to my stance of bravado and give her\nThe same uninterested look that she, gave, me\n(She was so beautiful) She was so beautiful\nBut what.. can I offer her?\n\nYou say that you'll love me forever but\nBut what about today?\nAs the dusks become the dawns and the years pass on will you\nLove me (love me) the same way (the same way)?\nIf so let us rejoice and bathe in this constant pleasure\nIf not spare my heart today and I shall recover before, forever\nAnd if my doubts and questions upset you\n(forgive my fragile heart) forgive my fragile heart\nI just wanted to know if you'd love me forever before today\nWould start (would you love me.. would you love me..)\n\n[Sung]\nWhat of a love unspoken?\nWhat of a love unspoken?\n\n{*applause and shouting*}[Intro: Money B, and 2Pac]\nYeah, its another classic cassette, Goin Way Back Show, exclusive you know
