Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album, resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character of not only Mr Shakur but of Death Row Records as well. Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac\\'s – excuse me – Makaveli\\'s verbal assault on Mobb Sleep, Notorious P.I.G., and several other New York rappers. JAY-Z from \"Hawaiian Sophie\" fame, Big Little whatever, and several other corny-sounding motherfuckers are understandably shaken up by this release.

composure, I’m gettin’ close\\nTo packin’ up and leavin’ notes, and gettin’ ghost\\nTell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go\\nTo clear my head I’m feelin low, losin’ control\\nMy heart is sayin’ leave, oh what a tangle web we weave\\nWhen we conspire to conceive, and now\\nYou gettin’ calls at the house, guess you cheatin’\\nThat’s all I need to hear cause I’m leavin’, I’m out the

juice\\nI say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots\\nI give a holla to my sisters on welfare\\n2Pac cares if don't nobody else care\\nAnd I know they like to beat you down a lot\\nWhen you come around the block, brothers clown a lot\\nBut please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up\\nForgive, but don't forget, girl, keep ya head up\\nAnd when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him\\nAnd if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him\\n‘Cause, sister, you don't need him\\nAnd I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em\\nYou know what makes me unhappy?\\nWhen brothers make babies\\nAnd leave a young mother to be a pappy\\nAnd since we all came from a woman\\nGot our name from a woman and our game from a woman\\nI wonder why we take from our women\\nWhy we rape our women — do we hate our women?\\nI think it's time to kill for our women\\nTime to heal our women, be real to our women\\nAnd if we don't we'll have a race of babies\\nThat will hate the ladies that make the babies\\nAnd since a man can't make one\\nHe has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one\\nSo will the real men get up?\\nI know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up\\n\\n[Hook]\\nKeep ya head up, ooh, child\\nThings are gonna get easier\\nKeep ya head up, ooh, child\\nThings'll get brighter\\nKeep ya head up, ooh, child\\nThings are gonna get

ghetto didn't seem so tough\\nAnd though we had it rough, we always had enough\\nI huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules\\nRan with a local crew and had a smoke or two\\nAnd I realize Mama really paid the price\\nShe nearly gave her life to raise me right\\nAnd all I had to give her was my pipe dream\\nOf how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen\\nI'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents\\nIt's hard to be legit and still pay the rent\\nAnd in the end it seems I'm headin' for the pen\\nI try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind\\nLast night my buddy lost his whole family\\nIt's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity\\nIt seems the rain'll never let up\\nI try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up\\nYou know, it's funny, when it rains it pours\\nThey got money for wars but can't feed the poor\\nSay there ain't no hope for the youth\\nAnd the truth is it ain't no hope for the future\\nAnd then they wonder why we crazy\\nI blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby\\nWe ain't meant to survive, ‘cause it's a set-up\\nAnd even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up\\n\\n[Hook]\\nKeep ya head up, ooh, child\\nThings are gonna get easier\\nKeep ya head up, ooh, child\\nThings'll get brighter\\nKeep ya head up, ooh, child\\nThings are gonna get easier\\nKeep ya head up, ooh, child\\nThings'll get brighter\\n\\n[Verse 3]\\nAnd uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own\\nI know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone\\nDaddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome\\nThank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em\\n‘Cause I think we can make it; in fact, I'm sure\\nAnd if you fall, stand tall and come back for more\\n‘Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son\\nWants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'\\nYou can't complain you was dealt this\\nHell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless\\nBecause there's too many things for you to deal with\\nDyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless\\nWhile tears is rollin' down your cheeks\\nYou steady hopin' things don't fall down this week\\n‘Cause if it did, you couldn't take it\\nAnd don't blame me — I was given this world, I didn't make it\\nAnd now my son's gettin' older and older\\nAnd cold from havin' the world on his shoulders\\nWhile the rich kids is drivin' Benz\\nI'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin' friends\\nAnd it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up\\nBut please, you got to keep ya head up\", 'image':

Loosen up, girl, I ain't going\\nNowhere, let's let that sucker stay out there\\nWhile he's stressed out and knock I stretch out the cock\\nHold the boots, and let a nigga execute\\nAnd though you got it right, I'm going home tonight\\nYou say you don't need a man, but I don't care\\nYou're in the presence of a player, I'd rather be ya nigga\\n\\n[Chorus: 2Pac]\\nI'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A\\nSo we can get drunk and smoke weed all day\\nIt don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life\\nThese busters ain't loving you right\\nSo I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A\\nSo we can get drunk and smoke weed all day\\nIt don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life\\nThese busters ain't loving you right\\nI'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A\\nSo we can get drunk and smoke weed all day\\nIt don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life\\nThese busters ain't loving you right\\nI'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A\\n(I'd rather be yo' nigga)\", 'image': 'https://images.genius.com/f0e663efef180da9b5d259005a1919e3.589x589x1.jpg'}, {'title': 'Ready 4 Whatever', 'album': 'R U Still Down?

up\\n‘Cause things change, and jealousy becomes a factor\\nBest friends at your wife's house, tryin' to mack her\\nI'm on tour, but still they keep on knockin' at my door\\nAnd I got no time to worry, I'm steady wanting more\\nEvery day is a test, yes, I try hard\\nBut I'm strugglin' with every breath, I pray to God\\nThat the woman that I left at home, all alone\\nThere ain't nothing like tryin' to bone, over the phone\\nIn my mind I can see her naked, I can't take it\\nGot me shaking at the thought that we can make it\\nI thought you knew\\n\\n[Chorus: Nate Dogg]\\nI'm rollin' out on tour

tuck you in even though I can't make it home\\nI whisper things in your ear like you're near me\\nWonder if you feel me from far away, and can you hear me?\\nIt seems to me, that you're jealous\\n‘Cause I'm hustling and making money with the fellas\\nIn the backstreets, tryin' to track me, baby, hold up!\\nThugs get lonely too, but I'm a soldier\\nAnd there's no way I'ma stop making money\\n‘Cause your attitude's changed and you're acting a little funny\\nAlways complaining, saying we don't spend time\\nCan't you see I got enough stress on my mind?\\nAnd hanging up like you all that\\nThen get mad when I tell you that I'm busy, baby, call back\\nPlease, ain't nothing left to say to you\\nThugs get lonely too, you know\\n\\n[Chorus: Nate Dogg]\\nI'm rollin' out on tour

out loud to you, like you're there\\nTake your picture out my back pocket, man, it's on\\nYou're the first face I wanna see when I get home\\nWanna love you 'til the sun rise, buckwild\\nTouching every wall in the house, thug style\\nPut your hands on the headboard, think of me\\nDrippin' sweat on top of you, sink and see\\nThis in your head that I'm making love, so turn the lights down\\nReminisce and relax ‘cause, baby, right now\\nI feel it in the middle of my stomach\\nYou whisper in my ear and baby, tell me how you really want it\\nHold on tightly, watch the
