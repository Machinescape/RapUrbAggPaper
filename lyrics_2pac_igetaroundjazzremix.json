Hahaha, please...\n\n[Verse 2: 2Pac]\nFingertips on the hips as I dip\nGotta get a tight grip, don't slip; loose lips sink ships\nIt's a trip, I love the way she licks her lips, see me jockin'\nPut a little twist in her hips \u2018cause I'm watchin'\nConversations on the phone 'til the break of dawn\nNow we're all alone, why the lights on?\nTurn them off! Time to set it off, get you wet and soft\nSomethin' is on your mind, let it off\nYou don't know me, you just met me, you won't let me\nWell, if I couldn't have it (silly rabbit) why you sweatin' me?\nIt's a lot of real G's doin' time\nCause a groupie bent the truth and told a lie\nYou picked the wrong guy, baby, if you're too fly\nYou need to hit the door, search for a new guy\n'Cause I only got one night in town\nBreak out or be clowned, baby doll are you down?\nI get around\n\n[Chorus: 2Pac & (Shock G)]\nWhat you mean you don't know?\n(Round and round, around they go)\nCheck it, check it, I get around\nThe Underground just don't stop for hoes\n(Round and round, around they go)\nI get around, still down with the Underground\n(Round and round, around they go)\nI get around, yeah, ayo Shock, let them hoes know\n(Round and round, around we go)\n\n[Verse 3: Shock G & (Money B)]\nNow you can tell from my everyday fits I ain't rich\nSo cease and desist with them tricks (tricks)\nI'm just another black man caught up in the mix (mix)\nTryna make a dollar out of 15 cents (a dime and a nickel)\nJust cause I'm a freak don't mean that we could hit the sheets\nBaby, I can see, that you don't recognize me\nI'm Shock G, the one who put the satin on your panties\nNever knew a hooker that could share me; I get around\n\n[Verse 4: 2Pac]\nRound and round, the Town we go\nBut the Underground just don't stop for hoes\nWhat do ya know? Another young bro making dough\nBut the po-po won't let me go, tryna do my show\nBut other young bros wanna throw\nTime to hit the do', grab a hoe\nDon't forget my dough, and if the promo say \"no\"\nLet 'em meet my 4-4, I'm from the O\nAnd yo, I get around\n\n[Outro: Shock G]\nRound and round, around we go\nRound and round, around we go, uhh\nRound and round, around we go\nRound and round, around we go\nRound and round, round we go\nRound and round, round we go\nRound and round, round we go\nRound and round we go...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9b791e9e8865e577e788752e38145914.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
