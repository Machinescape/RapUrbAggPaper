I don't know, I forgot\\nAll I know is that I'd die for pot, make the cypher hot\\nSmoke weed and fuck up my life a lot\\nGive me the money now, bitch\\nDid you want to see your wife or not?\\n'Fore I stab her wit' this knife I got\\nI got a sci-fi plot like a science fiction flick that I'm a hit you wit'\\nI got the Outsidaz up in this bitch\\nPeace to Thirstin' Howl, A.L. and Wordsworth\\nMy mother smoked crack, I had a premature birth\\nI'm just a nerd cursed wit' badly disturbed nerves\\nWho wanna step to this and get served first?\\nNinety-nine percent of aliens prefer Earth\\nSo I'm here to rule the planet, startin' wit' your turf\\nI hid a secret message inside of a word search\\nWit' smeared letters, runnin' together in blurred spurts\\nRappers can't fuck wit' me, it hurts worth\\nWhen they get abolished, polyps'll murk worse\\nWrote a secret message inside of a word search\\nWit' smeared letters, runnin' together in blurred spurts\\nRappers can't fuck wit' me, hollerin', 'Nurse, nurse'\\nYou said this shot would numb it, bitch, it just hurts worse\\nRappers can't fuck wit' the way that I spit it, lyrical lit it\\nNow you did it when I committed, get his rhymes out here\\nOff the top of the dome wit' a popular poem\\nFuck a team, I can stop you alone\\nRappers don't understand it\"}"
