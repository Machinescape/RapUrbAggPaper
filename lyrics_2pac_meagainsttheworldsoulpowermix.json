I'm out here all by myself, see\nLadies in stores, Baby Capone's, livin' wealthy\nPictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin'\nSeein' Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons\nAlready crazy and screamin', I guess them nightmares as a child\nHad me scared but left me prepared for a while\nIs there another route for a crooked Outlaw?\nVeteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall\n\n[Verse 3: E.D.I. Mean]\nEvery day there's mo' death, and plus I'm dough-less\nI'm seein' more reasons for me to proceed with thievin'\nScheme on the schemin' and leave they peeps grievin'\n'Cause ain't no bucks to stack up\nMy nuts is backed up, I'm about to act up\nGo load the MAC up, now watch me klacka\nTried makin' fat cuts, but yo, it ain't workin'\nAnd evil's lurkin', I can see him smirkin' when I gets to pervin'\nSo what? Go put some work in and make my mail\nMakin' sales, riskin' 25 with a L, but oh well\n\n[Chorus: 2Pac & (Puff Johnson)]\n(Me against the world)\nWith nothin' to lose\nIt's just me against the world\n(Me against the world)\nIt's just me against the world, baby\n(Me against the world)\nI got nothin' to lose\nIt's just me against the world\n(Me against the world)\nIt's just me against the world, baby\n(Me against the world, me against the world)x2\n(Me against the world)\nMe against the world\n(Me against the world, me against the world)x2\n(Me against the world)\n\n[Verse 4: 2Pac]\nWith all this extra stressin'\nThe question I wonder is after death, after my last breath\nWhen will I finally get to rest through this oppression?\nThey punish the people that's askin' questions\nAnd those that possess steal from the ones without possessions\nThe message I stress: to make it stop, study your lessons\nDon't settle for less, even a genius asks his questions\nBe grateful for blessings\nDon't ever change, keep your essence\nThe power is in the people and politics we address\nAlways do your best, don't let the pressure make you panic\nAnd when you get stranded\nAnd things don't go the way you planned it\nDreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference\nPoliticians are hypocrites, they don't wanna listen\nIf I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change\nIt wasn't nothin' like the game; it's just me against the world\n\n[Chorus: 2Pac & (Puff Johnson)]\n(Me against the world)\nNothin' to lose\nIt's just me against the world, baby\n(Me against the world)\nGot me stuck in the game\nIt's just me against the world\n(Me against the world)\nNothin' to lose\nIt's just me against the world, baby\n(Me against the world)\n\n[Outro: 2Pac & Puff Johnson]\nHahaha, that's right\nI know it seem hard sometimes\nBut, uh, remember one thing\nThrough every dark night, there's a bright day after that\nSo no matter how hard it get\nStick your chest out, keep your head up, and handle it\nYeah...ooh...\nMe against the world, me against the world\nMe against the world, me against the world\nMe against the world, me against the world\nMe against the world", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8e5403b2ff8b0baf1f2e3b75849742be.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
