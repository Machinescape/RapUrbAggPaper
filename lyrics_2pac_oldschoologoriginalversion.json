Nothing but love for the old school\nThat's who were going do this one for, ya feel me?\n\n[Chorus: Grand Puba]\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n\n[Verse 1: 2Pac]\nI remember Mr. Magic, Flash, Grandmaster Caz\nLL, Raising Hell, but, that didn't last\nEric B. & Rakim was, the shit to me\nI flip to see a Doug E. Fresh show, with Ricky D\nAnd Red Alert was puttin' in work, with Chuck Chill\nHad my homies on the hill getting ill, when shit was real\nWhen I could still remember Raw, with Daddy Kane\nWhen De La Soul was puttin' Potholes in the game\nI can't explain how it was\nWhodini had me puffin' on that buddha gettin' buzzed\n'Cause there I was\nThem block parties in the projects and on my block\nIt diggy don't stop, sippin' on that Private Stock\nAnd through my speaker Queen Latifah, and MC Lyte\nListen to Treach, KRS to get me through the night\nWith T La Rock and Mantronix, to Stetsasonic\nRemember \"Push It\" was the bomb shit, nuttin' like the old school\n\n[Chorus: Grand Puba & (2Pac)]\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n(Nothin' like the old school)\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n(Nothin' like the old school)\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n(It ain't nothin' like the old school)\n\"What more could I say?

I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n(Nothin' like the old school)\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n\n[Verse 2: 2Pac]\nI had, Shell Toes, and BVD's\nA killer crease inside my Lee's when I hit the streets\nI'm playing skelly, Ringolevio, or catch a kiss\nBefore the homies in my hood learned to smack a bitch\nI remember. way back, the weak weed they had\nToo many seeds in the trey bag\nI'm on the train headin uptown, freestyling\nWith some wild kids from Bucktown, profiling\n'Cause the hoochies was starin'\nChecking what a nigga's wearin'\nI'm wondering if that's her hair, I remember\nStickball, humpin' hoochies on the wall\nOr taking leaks on the steps, stinking up the hall\nThrough my childhood, wild as a juvenile\nA young nigga tryin to stay away from Rikers Isle\nMe and my homies breakin nights, tryin to keep it true\nOut on the roof sipping 90 proof, ain't nuttin like the old school\n\n[Chorus: Grand Puba]\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n(Nothin' like the old school)\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n(Ain't nothin' like the old school)\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n(Nothin' like the old school)\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n\n[Collision: 2Pac]\nAy, Rich ain't nothin' like the muh'fuckin' old school, nigga\nAnd I know you kinda like reminiscin' when I just freak it to you like that\nSo why don't you flip that shit for these muh'fuckas to like, you know\nReally just let them see how you pick to the old school\n'Cause it ain't the same for every muh'fucka, you feel me?\nSo, uh, take us back, nigga\n\n[Verse 3: Richie Rich]\nPolyurethane busta, cracked in half\nYou claim you foldin' bank, but I know your bank stank\nI lived around the corner, I've seen you fully smoked\nMust I say some mo'? You weighed a buck-O-fo'\nAnd sold your TV for a bump 'cause it was way too late\nNow they sent you upstate and you done gained some weight\nYou's a baller, lying to them youngstas quick\nGot them thinkin' you sick and representin' your clique\n\n[Verse 4: 2Pac]\nRemember popping and locking to Kurtis Blow, the name belts\nAnd Scott LaRock the Super Ho back in Latin Quarters\nWhen Slick Rick was spittin La Di Da Di\nGaming the hoochies at the neighborhood block parties\nI remember, breakdancing to Melle Mel\nJekyll and Hyde, LL when he Rocks the Bells\nForget the TV, I'd rather hit the streets and do graffiti\nBe careful, don't let the transit cops see me\nAin't nothing like the old school\n\n[Chorus: Grand Puba]\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n(It ain't nothin' like the old school)\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n(It ain't nothin' like the old school)\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n(Hey, on the real though, ain't nothin' like the old school)\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n\n[Outro: 2Pac]\nAy, I was at Latin Quarters, nigga\nWhen Eric B. & Rakim did \"I Ain't No Joke\" for the first time\nAy, 'member muh'fuckas used to get their gold chain snatched?\nRemember that shit?\nRemember seeing Brooklyn go crazy up in the motherfucking party?\nRemember motherfuckers used to go, \"Is Brooklyn in the house?\"\nAnd motherfuckers would lose they goddamn mind!\nThat's the old school to me; that's what I'm sayin'\nI remember goin' places that motherfuckers was scared to say\nThey was from anywhere but Brooklyn; that shit was the bomb\nBack in the motherfucking old school, nigga\nRemember skelly, nigga? Knocking niggas out the box, popping boxes?\nRemember stickball? Member niggas to run that shit like that?\nRemember the block-- 'Member screaming up at your moms from the window?\nThe ice cream truck, remember all the mother--\n'Member the Italian Ices, yo?
