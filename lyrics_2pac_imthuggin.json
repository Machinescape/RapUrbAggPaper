I pray to the Lord\nBut he ignores me, unfortunately, \u2018cause I'm guilty\nShow me a miracle, I'm hopeless\nI'm chokin' off marijuana smoke\nWith every toke it's like I'm losin' focus\nFallin' to sleep while I'm at service, when will I die?\nForever paranoid and nervous, because I'm high\nDon't mention funerals, I'm stressin' and goin' nutty\nAnd reminiscin' 'bout them niggas that murdered my buddy\nI wonder: When will I be happy? Ain't nothin' funny\nFlashbacks of bustin' caps, anything for money\nWhere am I goin'? I discovered, can't nothin' save me\nMy next door neighbor's havin' convo with undercovers\nPut a surprise in the mailbox, hope she get it\nHappy birthday, bitch, you know you shouldn't have did it\nEverybody's dyin', am I next? Who can I trust?\nWill they be G's, and they look at me before they bust?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dbbdb7f208d5866d896da3ccaf431d59.681x681x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
