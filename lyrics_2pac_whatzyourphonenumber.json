Do you want to fuck me?\nJust \u2018cause I'm paid in the worst way? True!\nLookin' kinda good in your birthday suit\nI wonder if you're wild and you act shy\nDo you like to be on top or the back side?\nWatch me while you lick your lips\nShake your hips, goddamn, I love that shit\nYo, let's stop fakin', be real now\nI got a room and a hard-on; still down?\nMet you standing at a bar full of black dudes\nSaid you wanna see my scars and my tattoos\nWhen we head for my hideout, act right\nBoss player when I ride out, that's right\nWhat's ya phone number?\n\n[Hook]\nIf you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready\nBaby, let me give you a call\nHow long will it take to break you off?\n\nIf you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready\nBaby, let me give you a call\nHow long will it take to break you off?\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh shit, baby is a dime piece, more than just fine\nShe's personally blessed from the gods\nIf I seen her right now, she could get me hard\nDidn't want to talk to me 'til she see my car\nNever had sex with a rich rap star\n'Til I got her in the back of my homeboy's car\nTell me, why do we live this way?\nMoney over bitches, let me hear you say\nWhat's your phone number?\nAre you alone? Got a pocket full of rubbers, let's bone!\nTime for your girlfriend to take you home\nI had fun, but baby, gotta leave me alone\nPicture in my rhyme\nTake time to rewind these words I say\nIf you open your mind bet in a minute you'll find\nIt's time let the Outlawz play\nWhat's ya phone number?\n\n[Hook]\nIf you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready\nBaby, let me give you a call\nHow long will it take to break you off?\n\nIf you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready\nBaby, let me give you a call\nHow long will it take to break you off?\n\n[Girl and 2Pac converse]\n[Girl] Hello?\n[2Pac] Hello?
