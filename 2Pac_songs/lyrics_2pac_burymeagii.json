Life as a G\nThese money making activities is killin' me\nI'm tryna ball but this alcohol making me hurl\nParanoid like its me against the world\nWill I live or die?\nMy only question: When I ride will I be murdered, a victim of some homicide, did I deserve it?\nMy life is full of misery\nForgive me Lord\nThe streets are full of enemies watch over me\nIntoxicated I can barely see\nI can't sleep having dreams somebody's killing me\nAm I sane?\nMy life is pain and I'm stressin'\nBrothaz be trippin'\nThey open fire where I rest\nHopin' for death\nBut I'm still livin' every breath\nWon't be for me\nRetaliation every death\nLets make em' bleed\nCause do or die is the only way\nAnd though I pray\nI can see you getting sicker everyday\n\n[Hook: 2Pac]\nAnd I ain't got time for snitches\nGotta keep my mind on my money and my riches\nEven when I die they don't worry me\nMama don't cry, bury me a G\nSee I ain't got time for snitches\nGotta keep my mind on my money and my riches\nEven when I die they don't worry me\nMama don't cry, bury me a G\n\n[Verse 2: Mutah (Napoleon)]\nSomething about this game that keep a shory holler for pain\nBut when the ???jump from the front??? I'mma do my thing\nI got problems, so I loc'd up, when they killed my parents\n??? so i took the hit for granted, and a revolver will be my only hope for escape, talking 'bout doing the same\nBut the feeling can wait, who can you blame on these inner-city streets?\nThey screaming out 'Peace!', but everybody is deceased\nJust bury me a G...\n\n[Verse 3: K-Dog (Kastro)]\nNah, I ain't afraid, just pary that I make top-grade\nIn the stray, getting paid is the way i play (what?) for keeps", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dbbdb7f208d5866d896da3ccaf431d59.681x681x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
