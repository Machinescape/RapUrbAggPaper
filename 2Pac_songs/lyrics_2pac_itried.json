I can't take her to places she wanna go to\nSo we argue and play fight, all day and night\nMakin passionate love 'til the daylight\nPlus we about to get evicted, can't pay the rent\nGuess it's time to see who really is yo' friend\nTell me you pregnant and I'm amazed\nSo many blessings while we stressin\nBut what can I say, keep yo' head up and\nTry to keep the faith\nTry to keep the faith\nTry to keep the faith\n\n\n[Verse 3: 2pac]\n\nSquare fools, since back in high school\nWe was true, me and you hardly parted or separeted\nWe stayed faded\nAffiliated with gangbanger and still made it\nUp in the gym, mess with me, gotta mess with him\nStill dressing like grown men when rolling\nI went to dark, smoking Newports, gaming marks\nGot a place in my heart, homie stay smart\nLocked you up in the penn'\nAnd gave you three to ten\nI send you letters with naked flicks of old friends\nHoping you well, I know it's hell doing time in the cells\nYou need mail, when you in jail\nAnd me I'm doing cool\nI settled down, had a family\nWorking in night school\nEvery once in a while\nI reminisce and wonder how we ever came to this", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dbbdb7f208d5866d896da3ccaf431d59.681x681x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
