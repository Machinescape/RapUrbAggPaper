You and your crew are through now\nThink the ice is meltin', 'cause brothers are comin' true now\nHitting it with the furious styles, and I'm paid to say\nHip-hop's here to stay, they fade away\n\n[Chorus]\nHe who writes for Billboard Charts\nBut kicks no material from inside the heart\nThey fade away, fade away\n\n[Verse 2: 2Pac]\nTo Mister Sambo [?] look alike\nHook it like crook, I step-fucker and took your mic\nAnd when there's not a single instrument playin'\nAnd ain't nobody prayin', I can't hear a word that you sayin'\nHeard you sold two million records in a million states\nBut there's a million faker and mill get snakes sellin' a million tapes\nAnd the typical types don't impress me\nShe's depressed on the quest to undress me\nSometimes I jest, I don't vest, so don't test me\nThis ain't no bus, so don't rush or arrest me\nDon't disrespect me, punk, I'm a citizen\nMaking money and rippin' angels is beautiful world we're living in\nLooking at the Grammy nominations, smilin' in my face and\nWaitin' to take my place at the pace of a corporation\nThis is just a taste of the aggravation, frustration\nHaving a faith in your occupation\nCops think I'm selling a basin, I'm selling tapes and\nTryna take my race to the better place and\nPeace to the brothers that paved the way\nRollin' over in they grave today while they fade away\n\n[Chorus]\nHe who writes for Billboard Charts\nBut kicks no material from inside the heart\nThey fade away, fade away\nHe who writes for Billboard Charts\nBut kicks no material from inside the heart\nThey fade away, fade away\n\n[Break]\nFade away\nFade away\n[?] Never fade away\n[?] Never fade away\n[?] Never fade away\n[?] Never fade away\n\n[Verse 3]\n[?] never fade away and\nWe don't deal with tryin' to fade away\n[?] away with an AK\n[?]\n[?]\n[?] try to fade away\n[?] they all run away\nAway an AK\n\n[Break]\nNever fade away\nNever fade away (never, no!)\nNever fade away\nNever fade, never fade, never never fade away\n\n[Chorus]\nHe who writes for Billboard Charts\nBut kicks no material from inside the heart\nSo fade away, fade away\n\n[Outro]\n[?]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dbbdb7f208d5866d896da3ccaf431d59.681x681x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
