So now I'm back\nTo makin' promises to you, tryin' to keep it true\nWhat if I'm wrong, a trick to keep me holdin' on\nTryin' to be strong and in the process, keep you goin'\nI'm bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin' close\nTo packin' up and leavin' notes, and gettin' ghost\nTell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go\nTo clear my head I'm feelin' low, losin' control\nMy heart is sayin' leave, oh what a tangle web we weave\nWhen we conspire to conceive, and now\nYou gettin' calls at the house, guess you cheatin'\nThat's all I need to hear cause I'm leavin', I'm out the do'\nNever no more will you see me, this is the end\nCause now I know you've been cheatin', I'm a sucker for love\n\n[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]\nIf I had to give you more, it's only been a year\n(Sucker for love)\nNow I've got my foot through the door, and I ain't going nowhere\n(Sucker for love)\nIt took a while to get me here, and I'm gonna take my time\n(Sucker for love)\nDon't fight that good shit in your ear, now let me blow ya mind\n\n[Verse 3: 2pac]\nNow he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay\nAs you sit and pray, hoping the beatings'll go away\nIt wasn't always a hit and run relationship\nIt use to be love, happiness and companionship\nRemember when I treated you good\nI moved you up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood\nMe and you a happy home, when it was on\nI had a love to call my own\nI should seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes\nPreoccupied with gettin' tossed, no need to lie\nYou had a man and I knew it, you told me\nDon't worry bout it we can do it now I'm under pressure\nMake a decision cause I'm waitin', when I'm alone\nI'm on the phone havin' secret conversations, huh\nI wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness\nBut I need your faith in me, I'm a sucker for love\n\n[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]\nIf I had to give you more, it's only been a year\n(Sucker for love)\nNow I've got my foot through the door, and I ain't going nowhere\n(Sucker for love)\nIt took a while to get me here, and I'm gonna take my time\n(Sucker for love)\nDon't fight that good shit in your ear, now let me blow ya' mind", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dbbdb7f208d5866d896da3ccaf431d59.681x681x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
