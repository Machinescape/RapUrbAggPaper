I don't know I wasn't sleepin that long\nWhen i woke up (what happened brotha?)\nMy Microphone was gone\nFirst I panicked (how?)\nI put the cops on the case\nBut they was stumped (damn)\nWithout a clue or a trace\nSo as sure as smoking cigarettes is bad for your health\nIf i want my microphone back i'll find it my self\nSo I picked up the phone (For what?)\nI called Dizzy (What's up?)\nMy Mic's gone (Word?)\n(Let's get Busy)\nBefore I told Dizzy what I wanted to do\nHe was over at my house with the TMS crew\nHe said (Word is out on every mouth on the street\nNow that your mic is gone its not long 'til you're beat)\nAnd then it hit me (damn)\nI got a battle at 6\nWith out my microphone\nI'm guaranteed to get whipped\nYa might think its unbelievable\nBut word to the strength\nWhen it comes to rockin rhymes\nIm a musical nymph\nThey gave me other mics\nBut yo it wasn't no use\nI tried to rock it (one-two one-two)\nBut I couldn't get loose\nI said forget it\nYa microphone or not\nAnd I got to do this\nGive it all that I got (Yo what if ya lose?)\nIt'd be the first time I lost\nBut if I beat 'em it'd finally prove that I'm the boss\nI grabbed my leather jacket\nWalked through the streets\nWas hopin and payin\nStrictly dope won't get beat\nI begin to get hyped\nI was ready to fight\nYo I was confident that I win\nTo hell with the mic!\nI hop on to the stage\nDizzy started the beat\nThe sucka shivered\nBecause he tasted defeat\nThen I signaled to Dizzy\nBust a rhyme wit my head\nPerpetrator fell back (HA!)\nAnd then he was dead\nI was happy as hell\nCause I was lucky that night\nPut my hand in my pocket\nAnd there was my mic\nHaha\n\n(now why you tell em that?)\nThe case of the misplaced mic\n\nVerse 2 2pac (Rock T)\n\nI'm down with Strictly Dope\n(so?) That means I'm more than you can handle\n(hot?) I'm hotter than the wax from a candle\n(me?) That's Rock T he's my microphone companion\n(Lyrics?) Full of knowledge truth and understandin'\n(hobbies?) Rappin' is my only recreation\n(retire?) Ya must be on some kind of medication\n(why!?) Cuz I'll never loosin up my mic grip\n(drugs?) Never cuz i'm livin on the right tip\n(Sex?) Only with my girl becasue I love her\n(Babies?) Impossible I always use a rubber\n(bored?) Rarely cause I'm keepin' myself busy\n(scratch?) Nah, I leave the cuttin' up to Dizzy", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9e142d133ba86fd5bdc94a72f198e2e5.375x376x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
