Do you swear and confirm that the testimony that you are about to give is the truth, nothing but the truth, the whole truth?\n\n2Pac \u2013 I do\n\nPolice \u2013 Could you please state your full name for the record?\n\n2Pac \u2013 Yes, 2Pac Amaru Shakur\n\nPolice \u2013 What is your age and resident address?\n\n2Pac \u2013 I just turned 24 on the 16th of June. I live in Decatur, Georgia\n\nPolice \u2013 How did you get interested in music?\n\n2Pac \u2013 I started off with poetry, with writing poetry\n\nPolice \u2013 Junior High, High School?\n\n2Pac \u2013 Yes, Junior High, High School\n\n2Pac \u2013 And poets I saw when I looked on the Webs*, I did that personally, but then I started turning poetry into songs and I got more attention\n\nPolice \u2013 How did you get into rap?\n\n2Pac \u2013 It\u2019s of my opinion that I was rapping while I was writing poetry..\n\nPolice \u2013 Okay\n\n2Pac \u2013 and so I was into rap, I guess you could say from Junior High, when I wrote my first poems. And after I heard on the radio that there were other poets, who were making records and they were selling and it was working, that\u2019s when I decided to change the method of my poetry\n\nPolice \u2013 How do you define rap? What constitutes rap?\n\n2Pac \u2013 That\u2019s what it is to me: poetry. To me it\u2019s story-telling poetry\n\nPolice \u2013 To music, music with a beat?\n\n2Pac \u2013 With or without music you cannot define rap\n\nPolice \u2013 But it goes, it has sometimes a beat, a tune to it, doesn\u2019t it, even if it hasn\u2019t got accompaniment to it?\n\n2Pac \u2013 No, even a pentameter is rap. It\u2019s how you write it, the structure, it depends how you write it, and as to whether it has a beat, I guess it won\u2019t sell as much if you don\u2019t have a beat; the beat is more of a selling tool\n\nPolice \u2013 Now, you were performing by the time you did your solo-album what people call \u201cgangsta rap\u201d.,\n\n2Pac \u2013 No\n\nPolice \u2013 You were not?\n\n2Pac \u2013 No!\n\nPolice \u2013 What would you call what you were performing?\n\n2Pac \u2013 Rap music!\n\nPolice \u2013 Have you ever performed gangsta rap?\n\n2Pac \u2013 No!\n\nPolice \u2013 Okay, and why would you say that?\n\n2Pac \u2013 Because, Number One, I do not know what \u201cgangsta rap\u201d, is, number two, I would not classify what my music is as gangsta rap\n\nPolice \u2013 Have you heard the term?\n\n2Pac \u2013 A lot!\n\nPolice \u2013 Okay\n\nPolice \u2013 The next statement is a \u201cVictim for Real\u201d : \u201cI really got my ass beat, I really don\u2019t like police\u201d\n\n2Pac \u2013 I didn\u2019t say that. Where were you at right there? Oh, there. I didn\u2019t say that: that\u2019s not what it says\u2026It says: \u201cI\u2019m a victim for real, everything I talk is for real, I really got my ass beat, I really don\u2019t like \u2026\u201d The interviewer wrote POLICE\n\nPolice \u2013 Did you mean \u201d\u201d?\n\n2Pac \u2013 No\n\nPolice \u2013 What did you mean?\n\n2Pac \u2013 I really don\u2019t like \u201ccrooked police\u201d\n\nPolice \u2013 Okay. So you feel okay about other police?\n\n2Pac \u2013 Feel okay?\n\nPolice \u2013 You like other police?\n\n2Pac \u2013 I like everybody that just does their job; I mean it depends on, I don\u2019t know\u2026. Personally, if I meet someone that is kind-hearted*, that\u2019s true and that\u2019s fair, then I like them, especially in a position like that, when a person has to put their life on line*, and they can still be fair to everybody they meet, I definitely like them, and I admire that..\n\nPolice \u2013 Are you aware of any others who had shot a policeman, especially teenagers who shot policemen after listening..\n\nLawyer \u2013 \u201cafter ALLEGEDLY listening\u201d\n\nPolice \u2013 That\u2019s right, \u201cafter allegedly listening\u201d: they said they were listening to your music\n\n2Pac \u2013 NO\n\nPolice \u2013 and that\u2019s what caused them to do it..\n\n2Pac \u2013 But none of them said this until you guys started saying this, they put it all over the news and had Danny Quayle* say it..\n\nPolice \u2013 I\u2019m asking you, are you aware of any others?\n\n2Pac \u2013 No, NO!\n\nPolice \u2013 When did you first start getting fan-mail? Remember what year?\n\n2Pac \u2013 No, I don\u2019t\n\nPolice \u2013 I hear you said you also received unfavourable mail?\n\n2Pac \u2013 Yeah, like this!

Of all of the mail I\u2019ve ever gotten, I\u2019ve gotten only about 5 pieces, maximum\n\nPolice \u2013 And did you respond to that?\n\n2Pac \u2013 I responded to your hate mail..\n\nPolice \u2013 Have you ever used illegal drugs?\n\n2Pac \u2013 Marijuana, yes\n\nPolice \u2013 Any others?\n\n2Pac \u2013 No!\n\nPolice \u2013 How often have you used marijuana?\n\n2Pac \u2013 In my whole life? At what point in my life?\n\nPolice \u2013 Let\u2019s say from 17 on ?\n\nLawyer \u2013 I\u2019m going to instruct the witness* not to talk about any use of or possession of illegal substances: I don\u2019t believe that is relevant to this: He\u2019s admitted he used it\n\nPolice \u2013 I think it\u2019s absolutely relevant. You\u2019re trying to make him out to be a choir boy* and I\u2019m trying to see what he\u2019s really done\n\nLawyer \u2013 I haven\u2019t made him out to be anything\n\n2Pac \u2013 You\u2019re trying to make me out to be a devil!\n\nPolice \u2013 Was it your intention to try to get young black people to be violent to police?\n\n2Pac \u2013 No\n\nPolice \u2013 Were you trying to provoke anybody to do anything particular? Were you trying to provoke or to make people to do things?\n\n2Pac \u2013 Yes!\n\nPolice \u2013 Tell us what!\n\n2Pac \u2013 Think!
