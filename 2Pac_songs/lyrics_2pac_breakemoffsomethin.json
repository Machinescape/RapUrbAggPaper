somethin' (with that funky funky style)\nCome on break em off somethin'\nYea, come on break em off somethin' (with that funky funky style)\n\n[Verse 1: 2Pac]\nRed light, green light, one, two, three\nTell me why O.P.D. sweatin' me\nIs it for the major grip that I'm makin'\nIs it for the fact that 'Pac don't be fakin'\nBest think before you draw black\nI ain't the one to bite my tongue, 2Pacalypse will smoke back\nAnd I don't need a posse, my Glocks like a pocket full of rockies\nTakin' out the cop team\nDon't mock me, sucka just jock me\nFifty to the first that can drop me\nBetter talk it like ya walk it when we swing 'em\nYea little square we can sling 'em\nGot a posse you can bring 'em\nWatch me, pop, pop, bang, boom, ping 'em\nBig D's in the house, pass the crazy horse\n'Cause them suckaz can't fade me, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\n(Yea!, yea Mopreme Shakur, thug life, Outlaw)\nKill a nigga kill a nigga (strictly representing)\nCome on, break em off somethin'\nYea, come on break em off somethin' (with that funky funky style)\nKill a nigga kill a nigga\nCome on break em off somethin'\nYea, come on break em off somethin' (with that funky funky style)\n\n[Verse 2: Dub-C]\nNow make a make a way here I come with a clip\nDub-C and they got me on some freestyle type shit huh\nSo nigga go and run hard as you can and take cover\nMad circle mutilate motherfuckers\nAnd I can't stand them niggas in [?]\nFuck a dancer, I'm hoopin' 'cause my crew don't dance\nKhakis and them steel toe boots is how we roll\nMadder than a serial killer on a hoe stroll\nAnd I don't know about y'all but I'm down to rep\nPackin' all these niggas who be dissin' the underground\nMotherfuck god, I diss 'em on wax\nCatch 'em slippin' backstage start fadin' they ass\nOops there goes that ghetto mentality\nThe same reason you never see my video on your T.V\n'Cause we don't say what they want us to say\nFuck rhythm and blues and the police too fool\nYou niggas can't stop me if I gave ya a free steel to the jaw, you still couldn't drop me\nSo don't try to sneak on that creep tip\n'Cause you'll get that ass kicked quick bitch\nSo go in the house y'all here comes that crazy nigga flippin' on the mailman and innocent bystanders\nSuckers will get knocked down\nDub-C bringin' noise from the mother fuckin' underground\n\n[Chorus]\nKill a nigga kill a nigga\nCome on, break 'em off somethin'\nYea, come on break 'em off somethin' (with that funky funky style)\nKill a nigga, kill a nigga\nCome on break 'em off somethin'\nYea, come on break em off somethin' (with that funky funky style)\n\n[Bridge: Money B]\nWicked wicked, in that Oak Town fashion\nWicked wicked, in that Oak Town fashion\nWicked wicked, in that Oak Town fashion\nWicked Money B, I am that odical dodge\n(Who's bad?)\n\n[Verse 3: Money B]\nI'm the worst-est wicked as I wanna be\nStand if you want to, but don't you dare stand in front of me\nDaddy Mack trickin', what you did then all fuckin' shit up\nWell here's a little more dick for you to suck\nAnd all these years that I be rappin'\nStyles that I'll be flashin'\nKind of like Nike, I never have to ask questions\nAll it takes, is a place, and a place, and a time and a rhyme\nIf I find ya, you'll be hidin' in my face\nI'll be on it like a [?]\nStingin' like a bumble\nOut the trunk with this funky attitude\nFuck the humble\nGot this stamina to be on the mic\nMashin' in the stance with the stylist boots\nI'm a bout to catch a bulge in my pants\nAnd the bigger the butt, the bigger the nut\nThat I mistrust\nI can catch a bum rush\nLayin' in the cut, like a panther on the prowl\nSo agile\nDon't ask scoop\nYou're not a now\nBut I'll tellin' MC how, we should\nTake ya time, take ya, take ya, take ya time\nMc's take ya time, before ya start the rhyme\nYes!\nTake ya time, take ya, take ya, take ya time\nMC's take ya time, before ya start the rhyme\nSo are you Filthy McNasty?, rappin' too fast\nAsk me, I say we slow and flow and roll ya ass\nPeace to Down W, Big D, 2Pac, and Mack\nSideways to your mommas house\n\n[Chorus]\nKill a nigga kill a nigga\nCome on, break 'em off somethin'\nYea, come on break 'em off somethin' (with that funky funky style)\nKill a nigga, kill a nigga\nCome on break 'em off somethin'\nYea, come on break 'em off somethin' (with that funky funky style)\n\n[Verse 4: Deb-E]\nI shift the nigga no respect 'fore he plays me\nCome off that bullshit fool you can save these\n[?] you gets no props\nAnd if you think I'm fuckin' around, hear the gun pop\nGotta break your ass off, some of that reality\nNiggas don't know about the D to the E to the B\nSo I start kickin', the funky ass [?] shit\nThe shit on the microphone motherfuckers can't fuck with\nYou want something to play with?\nWarm your ass like gum\nAs I push in the clip pump pump\nFrom a woman's perspective\nLive from the motherland, here's my objective\nLet this microphone pump\nAs I pump and stomp huh\nTo make a fly guy gotta shake they rumps\n[?] too much\nMoney B and W.C. the D.E.B down with the motherfuckin S.T", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dbbdb7f208d5866d896da3ccaf431d59.681x681x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
