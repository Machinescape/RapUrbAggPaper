      "In today's music news: the ever-controversial 2Pac Shakur has just released another album under the alias \"Makaveli.\" Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artists' street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail inter-chart movement. Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album, resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character of not only Mr Shakur but of Death Row Records as well. Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac's – excuse me – Makaveli's verbal assault on Mobb Sleep, Notorious P.I.G., and several other New York rappers. JAY-Z from \"Hawaiian Sophie\" fame, Big Little whatever, and several other corny-sounding motherfuckers are understandably shaken up by this release. The question everybody wants to know is: why'd they get this nigga started? 2Pac – rather Makaveli – was not available for comment but released this statement:\n",

      "[Hook 2]Davey D: His mother, Afeni Shakur, was a member of the Black Panther Party.  She was pregnant with Tupac while in jail and on trial as one of the Infamous New York 21. This was a time where all the members of the party were accused of conspiracy to bomb public places. Afeni Shakur was eventually acquitted of all charges. Tupac's aunt Assata Shakur was also a member of the Black Panther Party. She was accused of killing a New Jersey state trooper. She eventually fled the country in exile. Today she still lives in Cuba. Tupac described his mom as a strong-willed woman who handled her business. His real father was unknown. As a youth, he identified with a pimp and petty hustler named \"Legs\" who later died from a crack-induced heart attack. Tupac was described as an energetic child who always liked to imagine himself in the lead role. His mom saw fit to enroll him at age 12 in the 127 Street Ensemble, which was a theatre group in Harlem, New York. Tupac’s first acting role was the character, Travis, in the play Raisin in the Sun. Tupac did not involve himself with rap until he and his family moved to Baltimore. As a young teenager, he took on the name \"MC New York.\" While living in Baltimore, Tupac continued his acting by auditioning and later being accepted in Baltimore's Prestigious School for the Arts. At age 17, Tupac moved with his mom to Marin City in the San Francisco Bay area. It was in Marin City that Tupac lived about street life. In an attempt to be accepted and fit in with his peers, Tupac became a petty hustler who sold drugs. It was in Marin City that Tupac rediscovered rap. He ingratiated himself in the Bay Area's emerging rap scene by joining a group called Strictly Dope. This group featured fellow Bay Area rap star Ray Luv. While a member of Strictly Dope, Tupac decided to branch out and he eventually became friends with Digital Underground’s lead rapper, Shock G. Tupac auditioned for the group and he eventually became part of the group first as a roadie and later as a dancer. He went on to be a hype man for the group Digital Underground. As a member of Digital Underground, Tupac became known as \"the rebel of the underground.\" Much of this had to do with his excitable and unpredictable personality. Tupac's tendency to stir up things had lead to many of his successes, as well as many of his troubles.\n",

Just as that drama was beginning to be sorted out, he was arrested in New York the following month and accused of sexually assaulting a female fan in his hotel room. In the backdrop of that controversy, Tupac managed to release another album entitled Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z., which featured the smash hits \"I Get Around\" and it's emotional tribute to women, \"Keep Your Head Up.\" During this time, Tupac was featured in two more movies. The first was Poetic Justice with Janet Jackson. Here he stirred things up again on the set by refusing to honor Miss Jackson's request to take an AIDS test. The other movie that featured Tupac came out in the Spring of '94 with a basketball movie entitled Above The Rim. Just like he did in the movie Juice, here Tupac adorned the role of a gangster.\n",

He resisted and was shot five times. Left for dead, Tupac shocked the world by not only surviving, but checking out the hospital just days after the incident. Tupac was in New York filming a video as well as awaiting the fate of his trial for the sexual assault charges he was indicted for the year before. He would eventually be sentenced to four and a half years in prison. He would also accuse former rap partner Notorious B.I.G. as the person who set him up to be shot. It was these accusations that intensified the supposed East/West Coast rivalry within hip hop. Now just before Tupac began serving his sentence for sexual assault charges, he released his third album entitled Me Against The World. It was on this album the world heard Tupac's tribute to his mom entitled \"Dear Mama.\" After serving a little more than seven months in New York's correctional facilities, Tupac was released on 1.3 million dollars bail and signed to Death Row Records, the home to Snoop Dogg and Tha Dogg Pound. He quickly made noise with the release of his hit song \"California Love,\" a track featuring himself and Dr. Dre. While awaiting his appeal, Tupac released the double album All Eyez On Me. It featured all sorts of artists, ranging from R&B crooner Jodeci to Baby Area locals like Dru Down and Richie Rich. Ironically while out on bail, Tupac had managed to again embroil himself in controversy. He was arrested twice for parole violations and accused of causing a disturbance that took place at the Soul Train Music Awards. Reports confirmed that he confronted Notorious B.I.G. backstage. On September 7th, 1996, 2Pac and CEO of Death Row Suge Knight left the Mike Tyson-Bruce Seldon fight in Las Vegas in Suge's car. A white Cadillac with four people inside pulled alongside at an intersection, and on person stepped out and opened fire. Tupac was hit four times while Suge escaped with minor injuries. Tupac was brought to the University Medical Center. On Friday, September 13, 1996, Tupac died after six days in critical condition. Tupac Shakur was pronounced dead at 4:03 PM. His body was later cremated. He was only 25.\n",

      "We go over in the corner. She's touching me. I lift up my shirt while I'm dancing, showing off my tattoos and everything. She starts kissing my stomach, kissing my chest, licking me and shit. She's going down, and I'm, like, Oh shit. She pulled my dick out; she started sucking my dick on the dance floor. That shit turned me on. I wasn't thinking, like, This is going to be a rape case. I'm thinking, like, This is going to be a good night. You know what I'm saying?\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon as she finished that-just enough to get me solid, rock-hard-we got off the dance floor. I told Nigel, \"I've got to get out of here. I'm about to take her to the hotel. I'll see you all later.\" Nigel was, like, \"No, no, no. I'm going to take you back.\" We drive to the hotel. We go upstairs and have sex, real quick. As soon as I came, that was it. I was tired, I was drunk, I knew I had to get up early in the morning, so I was, like, \"What are you going to do? You can spend the night or you can leave.\" She left me her number, and everything was cool. Nigel was spending the night in my room all these nights. When he found out she sucked my dick on the floor and we had sex, he and Trevor were livid! Trevor is a big freak; he was going crazy. All he kept asking me was, \"D-d-did you fuck in the ass?\" He was listening to every single detail. I thought, This is just some guy shit, it's all good.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a show to do in New Jersey at Club 88. This dude said, \"I'll be there with a limo to pick you up at midnight.\" We went shopping, we got dressed up, we were all ready. Nigel was saying, \"Why don't you give her a call?\" So we were all sitting in the hotel, drinking. I'm waiting for the show, and Nigel's, like, \"I called her. I mean, she called me, and she's on her way.\" But I wasn't thinking about her no second time. We were watching TV when the phone rings, and she's downstairs. Nigel gave Man-man, my manager, some money to pay for the cab, and I was, like, \"Let that b*tch pay for her own cab.\" She came upstairs looking all nice, dressed all provocative and shit, like she was ready for a prom date.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we're all sitting there talking, and she's making me uncomfortable, because instead of sitting with Nigel and them, she's sitting on the arm of my chair. And Nigel and Trevor are looking at her like a chicken, like she's, like, food. It's a real uncomfortable situation. So I'm thinking, Okay, I'm going to take her to the room and get a massage. I'm thinking about being with her that night at Nell's. So we get in the room, I'm laying on my stomach, she's massaging my back. I turn around. She starts massaging my front. This lasted for about a half an hour. In between, we would stop and kiss each other. I'm thinking she's about to give me another blow job. But before she could do that, some niggas came in, and I froze up more than she froze up. If she would have said anything, I would have said, \"Hold on, let me finish.\" But I can't say nothing, because she's not saying nothing. How do I look saying, \"Hold on\"? That would be like I'm making her my girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "So they came and they started touching her a**. They going, \"Oooh, she's got a nice ass.\" Nigel isn't touching her, but I can hear his voice leading it, like, \"Put her panties down, put her pantyhose down.\" I just got up and walked out the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I went to the other suite, Man-man told me that Talibah, my publicist at the time, had been there for a while and was waiting in the bedroom of that suite. I went to see Talibah and we talked about what she had been doing during the day, then I went and laid down on the couch and went to sleep. When I woke up, Nigel was standing over me going, \"Pac, Pac,\" and all the lights was on in both rooms. The whole mood had changed, you know what I'm saying? I felt like I was drugged. I didn't know how much time had passed. So when I woke up, it was, like, \"You're going to the police, you're going to the police.\" Nigel walks out the room, comes back with the girl. Her clothes is on; ain't nothing tore. She just upset, crying hysterically. \"Why you let them do this to me?\" She's not making sense. \"I came to see you. You let them do this to me.\" I'm, like, \"I don't got time for this shit right here. You got to chill out with that shit. Stop yelling at me and looking at me all crazy.\" She said, \"This not the last time you're going to hear from me,\" and slammed the door. And Nigel goes, \"Don't worry about it, Pac, don't worry. I'll handle it. She just tripping.\" I asked him what happened, and he was, like, \"Too many niggas.\" You know, I ain't even tripping no more, you know? niggas start going downstairs, but nobody was coming back upstairs. I'm sitting upstairs smoking weed, like, Where the fuck is everybody at? Then I get a call from Talibah from the lobby saying, \"The police is down here.\"\n",

But I know I feel ashamed-because I wanted to be accepted and because I didn't want no harm done to me-I didn't say nothing.{Gunshot}\n",

      "There he go! Ay 'Pac!\"Davey D: In 1991, Tupac got his first real taste of trouble when he was stopped for jay walking in downtown Oakland. According to Pac, the police officers did not take a liking to his name, for they said some unfavorable things. Pac in return responded and the result was him being arrested and brutalized. This incident resulted  in him filing a 10 million dollar lawsuit against the City of Oakland. It wasn't long afterwards that Tupac released the first of his six albums. The first was entitled 2Pocalypse Now and it highlighted Tupac’s passionate, political, and thug life side. Songs like \"Trap\" while politically on point, stirred up much of the controversy when it depicted an Oakland police officer being shot at the end of the video. This particular song caught the attention of Dan Quayle, who expressed his outrage. Other songs like \"Brenda Got a Bay\" brought attention to the emotional and heartfelt side of the rising star. Tupac gained national fame when he played the role of Roland Bishop, a violent, insecure, short-tempered, psychotic individual, and the blockbuster movie Juice. Initially, director Ernest Dickerson had invited Digitial Underground's Money B to audition for the movie. Tupac went along for the ride. Once there, he read the part cold turkey and was hired to play his role, which left many wondering if Tupac was acting or just being himself. As Tupac's popularity began to soar, so did his troubles. In the Summer of ’92 while attending Marine City's 50th Anniversary, Tupac and his entourage had a confrontation with some old acquaintances. During the ensuing fight, a gun was drawn, shots were fired, and a little six-year-old laid dead as an innocent bystander. Tupac's brother Mercedes, who at the time rapped for the group Tony! Toni! Toné! and later for Thug Life, was arrested and charged. Eventually he was let go for lack of evidence. Tupac later found himself embroiled in more controversy when a Texas cop was shot and killed. The widow of the slain officer filed the multi-million dollar civil suit against Tupac, claiming that it was his music and lyrics that influenced the young perpetrator to kill. If that wasn't enough, also in that year, Tupac while visiting the set of Fox TV's In Living Color had an altercation with the limo driver. The result was him being arrested and charged with assault. Eventually the charges would drop. Seemingly wherever Tupac went, trouble followed. First Tupac found himself being charged with assault after he and a group of friends beat up the film directors known as the Hughes Brothers. This incident stemmed from him being fired from the movie Menace II Society.\n",
