I change my ways\nAnd every day, I'm a hustler, getting paid\nI see visions of me dead, lord are you there?\nA closed casket at my funeral, and no one cares\nIs there a heaven for a G?\nI'm telling you now, you motherfuckers don't know me\n\n[Verse 2: 2Pac]\nThe motherfucking dust kicker, who can you trust?\nDo have you the heart to see a nigga\nBefore you bust?\nMy name is spoken on the tongues of so many foes\nBusting motherfuckers out the box, I ain't even gone\nNow how the hell do you explain, my claim to fame\nFrom doing flicks to busting tricks out the fucking frame\nGot these bitches on my jock, niggas on my block\nJealous ass suckers, got em ducking from my smoking Glock\nAnd busting niggas asses to stay alive\nSkinny ass player watching bigger motherfuckers fry\nThey ask me how I\u2019m living? I\u2019m a hustler\nBucking busters, 'til they die\nNow it's on in the ghetto, you ain't heard?\nNiggas got they AK\u2019s heading for the burbs\nAiming at them skin-head bitches let it rain\nGiving em a wet welcome to the house of pain!\n\n[Hook: 2Pac]\nI see visions of me dead, lord are you there?\nA closed casket at my funeral, and no one's there\nIs there a heaven for a killer? I change my ways\nAnd every day, I'm a hustler, getting paid\nI see visions of me dead, lord are you there?\nA closed casket at my funeral, and no one cares\nIs there a heaven for a G?\nI'm telling you now, you motherfuckers don't know me\n\n[Verse 3: 2Pac]\nBut still I'm having memories of high speed when the cops crashed\nAs I laugh, pushing the gas while my Glocks blast\nWe was young and we was dumb, but we had heart\nIn the dark, will we survive through the bad parts?\nMany dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes\nNo hesitation in extermination of these snitches\nEnvious bitches, they still continue to pursue me\nA couple of movies, now the whole world's trying to screw me\nEven the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?\nBut stay true, sipping 22's of brew\nAnd now media is trying to test me\nGot the press asking questions, trying to stress me\nMisery is all I see, that's my mind state\nMy history with the police will shake the crime rate\nMy main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped\nTwo- Two strikes slipped got arrested and flip\nHe screamed \"thug life\"\n\n[Hook: 2Pac]\nI see visions of me dead, lord are you there?\nA closed casket at my funeral, and no one's there\nIs there a heaven for a killer? I change my ways\nAnd every day, I'm a hustler, getting paid\nI see visions of me dead, lord are you there?\nA closed casket at my funeral, and no one cares\nIs there a heaven for a G?\nI'm telling you now, you motherfuckers don't know me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dbbdb7f208d5866d896da3ccaf431d59.681x681x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
