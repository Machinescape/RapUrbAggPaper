I'm not livin' in the past\nYou wanna last? Be the first to blast\nRemember Kato, no longer with us, he's deceased\nCall on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets\nNow he rest in peace\nIs there a heaven for a G? Remember me\nSo many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears\n\n[Chorus]\nLord, God\nShed so many tears\nLord, God\nShed so many tears\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means\nLabel me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen\nAnd fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed\nI'm havin' visions of leavin' here in a hearse\nGod, can you feel me? I'm not livin' in the past\nYou wanna last? Be the first to last\n\n[Spoken Word]\nHey, yo, go to the next shit\nHey, yo, I got some new shit for you tonight\nOh yes\nSee, it's this nigga named Nas\nAnd he kick it with these niggas called Mobb Deep\nAnd they kick it with these niggas named Bad Boy\n(Bad Boy killa)\nBut I say fuck 'em all!\nSo I'm about to take this nigga beat\nAnd whoop his ass with his own motherfuckin' beat\n(Tell them nigga)\nI send this out to Nas\nAnd any one else down with that clique", "image": "https://images.genius.com/aceb98afaa438b9a1b348f7296ac142f.594x594x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
