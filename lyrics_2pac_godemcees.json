Because we didn\u2019t get any of that history from any of those soldiers that we lost--we got none of that. They all went to jail, if you can remember. They all went to penitentiaries\n\nVerse 01 2Pac :\nCallin' all dogs and phony rap stars\nWho think they got me\nI'm on some Superman shit now\nThey shouldn't have shot me\nUh\nCause I'm convinced that my squad is real\nAnd God has blessed me with the power to be hard 2 kill\nI got a mind that's full of murderous thoughts\nWhen unleashed\nI make them niggas bow\nFeel me now or be deceased\nI ain't choosing sides\nHell no\nFuck everybody\nIt's Westside when I ride watch 4 dead bodies\nLyrics are colorful words and anesthetics\nProblems are getting worked out faster than calisthenics\nI'm bullet proof\nBlazed up on top of my man's roof\nHands on a fully AK so what'chu plan to do\nMoon motherfuckaz 'til they feel me\nIt's West Coast nigga fuck New York\nNow did everybody hear me?\nYou shot at my homies now Imma blast\nScreamin' Thug Life muthafucka when I pass\n\nHook:\nNY '87\nNY '87\nNY '87\nNY '87\n\nVerse 02 Rakim :\nDance floor's dangerous\nPacked in like a briefcase\nRhyth with ral rough rhyme\nBeats with deep bass\nGirls with tight pants\nMaybe they might dance\nTonight if the Rs on the mike\nThere's a slight chance\nThe crowd is crucial\nM.C.'s grounds are neutral\nNow that you're here let me introduce you\nGet ready\nI'm hard read like graffiti but steady\nScience I drop is real heavy\nRadiant energy, that'll be the penalty\nTouch the third rail on the pain of remedy\nThe prescription's one every hour\nNow it's a HABIT\nYa need another hit from the freestyle fanatic\nAttention: follow directions real close\nKeep out of reach of children\nBeware of overdose\nToo many milligram\nNO ONE made a iller jam\nMy rhyme is the rhythm of thoughts\nThat kill a man\nIdeas for the ear to fear\nMight split 'im\nHe'll never forget 'im\nHe'll rest in peace wit' 'em\nAt least when he left he'll know what hit 'im\nThe last breath of the words of death\nWas the rhythm\nNY '87", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dbbdb7f208d5866d896da3ccaf431d59.681x681x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
