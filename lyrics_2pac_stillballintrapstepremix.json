Blame it on my mama, I'm a thug nigga\nUp before the sun rise, quicker than the drug dealers\nTell me if it's on, nigga, then we first to bomb\nBust on these bitch-made niggas, hit 'em up, Westside!\nAin't nobody loved me as a broke nigga\nFinger on the trigger, Lord forgive me if I smoke niggas\nI love my females strapped, then fuck her from the back\nI get my currency in stacks, California is where I'm at ridin'\nPassed by while these niggas wondered why\nI got shot but didn't die, let 'em see who's next to try\nDid I cry? Hell nah, nigga, tears shed, for all my homies in the pen\nMany peers dead; a nigga still ballin'\nStill ballin' until I die (until I die)\nYou can bring your crew, but we remain true\nMotherfucker, still ballin' (I be ballin')\nNiggas wonder why (they wonder why)\nYou can bring your crew, but we remain true\nMotherfucker, still ballin'\nNow, as I kneel and pray I hope the Lord understand\nWhen he's gone, devolve, I become a dangerous man\nAin't crazy or deranged, I'm sayin'\nBut when these kids go to spray 'em, boy, won't be playin'\nWith clientele, any rhyme sales\nQuestion is: Will you fuck-niggas ride for real, huh?\nBitch nigga, this is G-rated\nPlus your homeboy won't make it, street game Fugazi\nI'm elevated to the top of this shit\nDone fucked around and put me and 2Pac on the bitch\nAnd you can tell 'em \"Thug Life\" was the reason for this\nAnd I ride for any nigga who believe in the shit; still ballin'\nUntil the day I die\nYou can bring your crew, but we remain true\nMotherfucker, still ballin'\nNiggas wonder why\nYou can bring your crew, but we remain true\nMotherfucker, still ballin'\nNow everybody wanna see us dead\nTwo murdered on the front page\nShot to death, bullets to the head\nNiggas holla out my name and it's similar to rape\nMotherfuckers know I'm comin', so they runnin' to they graves\nWatch! Swoop down with my nigga from the Pound\n\u2018Cause Trick don't give a fuck\nWhere you coward niggas now?\nBlast, keep pumpin', ain't worried about nothin'\nBusters thought we was frontin'\nSo reload and keep dumpin'; still ballin'\nYou can bring your crew, but we remain true\nMotherfucker, still ballin' (I be ballin')\nNiggas wonder why (they wonder why)\nYou can bring your crew, but we remain true\nMotherfucker, still ballin'\n'Til the day I die (still ballin')\nYou can bring your crew, but we remain true\nMotherfucker, still ballin'\nNiggas wonder why (tell 'em!)\nYou can bring your crew, but we remain true\nMotherfucker, still ballin', until the day I die\n(Thug life), still ballin'\nMotherfucker, still ballin'\nStraight motherfuckin' ballin'", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dbbdb7f208d5866d896da3ccaf431d59.681x681x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
