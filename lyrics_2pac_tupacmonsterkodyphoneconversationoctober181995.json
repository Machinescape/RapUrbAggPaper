And I'm talking to Al Sharpton about this, some other motherfuckers with some power. And then when we do that, we register to the voters, and if we can register for Democrats, Republican or independent. Once we register to the voters, we have power. Then we start going up to the mayors of these cities and telling them, \"Look, we got this many voters in this city; we want you to do this we want a community center.\" We start hittin' up Nike for the free clothes and [?] stores for the free computers in each community center.

It was a big plan, I just caught it like at the end. And that's why they shot me.\nS: Man! Hey man, you gotta stay up man. When you step through that, that way you gotta be on point.\nT: I ain't goin' through there no more, if I do, I'm going with hundred motherfuckers.\nS: And I'll be one of them.\nT: Yup, no doubt.\nS: No dizoubt. We can't be having you not here you know what I'm saying\nT: I know that's what they told me but you know what, you know what it was?\nHere's my problem just like I'm telling you what she saying, I always 'cause I'm where my mom ama raised me the way I'm moving in, they fucked my head in a way, see like you, you could be movement oriented but you got the gang bang shit first in your mind.\nS: Right, right\nT: My shit the gang bang shit come second to me\nS: Right, right\nT: And now I'm trying to make it come first 'cause that movement shit will fuck you up. Movement shit got me loving every brother\nS: Yeah! at that point you know I gotta get next to you [?]\nT: Right, to me I'm there for you, nigga need money and job I'm wit' you, niggas come to me with guns on, niggas hugging me with TECs on, you know what I mean?\nS: It just though. you know what the thing is man, we gotta be individuals too inside the movement and wherever we involved in right? We gotta be able to differentiate between cats that are firm and cats that's ain't firm, sometimes it take sometimes but test. We talk about friends that's mean, you know. I am who I am, I survived through what I survived through by being intelligent, by not allowing cats to outsmart me and putting me in precarious positions where I can get whacked, right?\nTrying to choose my friends very very carefully and I over said there's layers and layers of friends, you see. Some I hold close to the body, man, like a vest and others hold at arm's distance, some just look at, some I don't even fuck with, but the circles is small but the ones that are in there I believe are trustworthy right. For instance, you and I. You and I have been probably through the same shit in our lives\n\nT: No doubt.\n\nS: You know what I'm saying? and we're like 10 years apart, almost. So it's like almost a common destiny. What you grew up then is where I came around too. You see what I'm saying? The banging shit was first with me and then the movement. Wit' you the movement was first and then the banging was came second.\n\nT: Yes that's the ill shit.\nS: I'm getting around to where you grew up at\nT: And I'm getting around the way you grew up at.\nS:  You see so, so who else better, you see, who can get along like you and I?\n\nT: No doubt.\n\nS: Watching else's back\nT: No doubt\n\nS: 'Cause you want it, I want it, but together you know I mean. Man you got the courage of the godfather\nwhen the shit-- what happened when [?] wrote that piece [?] dealing with the pigs right, I was like that was my boy man\n\nT: No doubt! You see that's another problem I'm helping another nigga, nigga I don't even know, nigga in the middle of the streets, he run off and don't even help me.\n\nS: Yeah, that fucked up man!\n\nT: These niggas that shot me like wanna see that when a white trash put a gun on me I can prepared. You know what I mean? I can react. When a nigga pull a gun on me I'm like \"froze up\" I'm like \"oh shit a nigga gon kill me?\"\n\nS: You know what we should do, Pac? I'm telling you, me and you should sit down, right, and we should do a book on you, man.\n\nT: Yeah? How you gon' do that?\n\nS: You know what I'm talking about, I'm talking about, a straight up autobiography or something like that based on your life like Malcolm X [?] out with Alex Haley. I'm telling you, man. 'Cause the shit that you been through and I been through, just like my book man, I had to document that shit\n\nT: Hey, your book is I swear on everything homie, I'm not just saying this shit, your shit is a classic, yo when I was up in that jailhouse nigga who hated west side they don't like nothing, they loving you. I had those motherfuckers speechless, they was reading, niggas that can't read was reading your shit in one day, nobody can put that shit down.\n\nS: but yours just as explosive and I'm telling you, brother, I guarantee you before even get through it as a book Hollywood will be on our jock\n\nT: They already want me to be something, poppin' hoes in the back 'cause I can't get the right one, I asked like Maya Angelou to help me write autobiography, she was like \"okay\"\n\nS: You know what you need, somebody to write it from our level to kick the slang and the shit right. Maya Angelou might put some perfect English in that motherfucker.\n\nT: And then it ain't come out right.\nS: you and I we gon' kick the language we kick.\nT: figures like I be your shit\nS: I'm telling you.\nT: But you know where you gotta pull me into?\nS: What?\nT: Overstand.\nS: I'm telling you.\nT: Pull me here into overstand man\nS: dig it, this is the thing.\n\nT: lil do it one time and I ain't [?]\n\nS: okay dig it. The word \"understand\" is to play on one's person, right for instance, understand, to stand under, to be below, to be demeaned, and so. When you're under anything it's hard for you to get a whole view to of what's going on above-ground. So when you're under you have a disadvantage. So especially when you're standing on someone or under anything you can't comprehend it, you can't feel it, you can't vibe wit' it. So I created the word \"over-stand\" to get up over that shit, to get a vantage point, even looking down on some shit, you see what I'm sayin'. Like a helicopter got a vantage point over us when we have to get in the streets and break. They can see us better than a pig at our level\n\nT: So like that!\n\nS: The helicopter has an overstanding on us to great degree, you see what I'm saying, we have to do, words control people man I'm telling you. When you think.. when you speak positive, you think positive. So all the time I be trying to overstand shit, get a full comprehension\n\nT: that's right!\n\nS: you feel me? Yeah, that's where I came from, that concept came..\n\nT: That's right. Had you on that shit man\n\nS: They made me like pops, they made me like pops\n\n[Tupac's laughs]\n\nS: I'm telling you me and pops was like, 'cause when I had Mutulu million right, we were getting our court spot on, and he sending me the thugs code, of course I endorsed it right. Then, next thing I know, I got a clipping [prisoners of war] so we had to do whole another trip with the mayor, alright. And then I heard [?] has drowned.\n\nT: Yeah he aight now.\n\nS: [?] He's respiratory\n\nT: I'm in jail too they telling me that shit. But shit that's fucked up was like me and him used to talk all the time. When I first came to LA he was like my eyes and ears I told him everything. [?] that they he was like we was talking every day and they just killed that shit. I haven't talked to him in like a year. More than that\n\nS: But still they know you got legacy movement problems with the pigs, they stand to see you brother 'cause end up in the bloodline\n\nT: You ain't lying. [?] calling me hold up one more time\n...\n\nT: Hello\n\nS: Yeah\n\nT: But, man [?] shit that I couldn't even read your shit like how you been saying when hit the nigga in nuts and all that shit\n\nS: Yeah\n\nT: you ain't lying, I get up these motherfuckers calling me nigger, and I'm buggin out, I never had white people calling me nigger and nothing happened. And [?] you get 7 years if you touched the police no matter what, 7 years no matter what, 'cause I was in maximum security in Dannemora then they had me in a special program like a federal program they got called APPU - Advance Placement something something something - where all like notorious motherfuckers. I'm hopping in there niggas with 80\u00ad. Damn, one more time...\n\nS: Alright\n\nT: Hello. I'm up in there with niggas with 80 years and 60 years and I'm doing one and a half to four and a half. And I'm knowing my life in danger. These niggas ain't never getting out.\n\nS: Yeah I've seen moms on [?] she was [?] that right? That she had you in a maximum security prison.\n\nT: Yup! locked down 23 hours a day\n\nS: that's how you had me\n\nT: Before I even broke the rules\n\nS: And that's heavy. And you didn't even get an opportunity to break one.\n\nT: And he was like for my own protection 'cause I wouldn't find it [?] but they got mad right, cause they was telling me that you goin to die in here and you gon die in here, I said why am just have to die here, I'm not starting no PC. He like they put you in IPC-- that's Involuntary Protective Custody.\n\nS: right right\n\nT: so I'm fighting I'm getting lawyers to fight me to get out of there to get me in population, cause they put me in population the first day I got there, right.\n\nS: Was it true?\n\nT: Hell yeah! Even though I'm on the other side I'm with all enemies. These niggas hating 'cause I'm banging on east coast, screaming, \"West side, west side\" any team everything. So when I get there\nthe pigs they ain't get me no toilet sheets, you know you come there you get that cock shit, it was bloody cot, no nothing\nhe left me in population for like two hours, in two hours I had everything I needed, niggas gave me two stakes, two\nniggas bringing knives, weed, heroin, cocaine everything I wanted, I was like \"nah I'm cool homie I don't need that\" I gave the niggas their bangers back, I didn't want no bangers, they want to stab me up for nothing, it was three murders while I was there\n\nS: Damn [?]\n\nT: they got the highest level of murders in New Work state.
