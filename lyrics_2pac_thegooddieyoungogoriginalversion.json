fallin' from the sky\n\nCan you tell me why\nDoes anybody have an answer why\nIt seems the good die young\nCan anybody tell me why\nCan anybody tell me why\n\n[Verse 1: 2Pac]\nIt was more than a tragedy, emotions be grabbin' me\nPlane fell from the sky, we tryna figure what happened\nBurnin\u2019 churches, fearin' God, who can be so cruel?\nWe all ignorant to AIDS 'til it happens to you\nJust be a man, make plans, listen to your voice\nA woman's tryin' to make decisions, we should leave them a choice\n'Cause who are we to say who lives and die, breathes and stops?\nAll this judgement on other lives needs to stop\nWhat are we livin' for, givin' more back than takin\u2019\nOn my knees still waitin\u2019 for my own salvation\nNow I feel abandoned 'cause Pat Buchanan say I\u2019m greedy\nYou can take my taxes, send me to war but can't feed me\nIt's so easy to regret thangs after they done\nBabies catchin' murder cases, scared to laugh in the sun\nThe tragedies that we all need, love in doses\nIn times like these we feel closest, the good die young\n\n[Chorus: Val Young + (2Pac)]\nDoes anybody have an answer why\n(It times like these we feel closest)\nIt seems the good die young\n(The good die young)\nCan anybody tell me why\n(Rest in peace, God bless the dead, and we carry on, huh)\nCan anybody tell me why\n(The good die young)\nDoes anybody have an answer why\nIt seems the good die young\n(The good die young)\nCan anybody tell me why\nCan anybody tell me why\n\n[Verse 2: Napoleon]\nNow in my world, will it get worse\nWhen I been trapped since birth?\nAnd I had to sleep in a hearse, \u2019cause it was my bed first\nMy grands probably burnin', turnin' in they grave\nSome folks ain't even get to see a high age\nBut they did, so I ain't afraid\nAnd this money got me feelin' like a star\nAnd this murder got me feelin' like my death ain't far\nIn the land of stolen cars, don't get no better\nDon't get no weaker or no harder\nI was raised in a rush without my moms and my, father\nSo tell me somethin'\nIf I grab my gat and get to dumpin'\nWould God get to lookin' at me funny?\nRest in peace to my mother Aquillah Beale\nRest in peace to my father Salek Beale\nAnd rest in peace to my grandmother, Mary Clark\nYou know I love you\n\n[Verse 3: Young Noble]\nWhich is worst, first Storm and then Al\nPac and then Yak, Regrey Brown\nCoulda' sworn I seen your face in a cloud\nFamily grievin' on your last breath\nClose to the heart whether you know it or not\nI swear the love won't stop\nJewel, that's my boo, Mom, Duke and Nu\nFrom jump you kept it true\nHelped to feed the crew\nThe good die young\nLivin' fast, jumpin' the gun\nMama blamin' the community for killin' her son\nMy cousin Darren wasn't scared of goin'\nBut never knowin' he was dyin' slower\nI guess I see ya when I see ya soulja\n\n[Chorus: Val Young]\nDoes anybody have an answer why\nIt seems the good die young\nCan anybody tell me why\nCan anybody tell me why\n\n[Verse 4: Kastro]\nI know my life ain't promised\nTherefore the wise move in silence\nAnalyze scandalous times\nIt's hard, dawg, but we managed\nAnd all probably damned for living our lives so unruly\nAin't a preacher that could fool me\nThere ain't a teacher that could school me\nSince a young soldier, never been sober while getting older\nPlaying this dirty game of life, making it hard to keep my hopes up\nI'm hopeless, just another lost soul that lost focus\nHomie, the good die young, pay attention and you'll notice\n\n[Verse 5: E.D.I Mean]\nDays go past and as they pass, time move, quicker\nNo time for wastin', put your hustle down my young dealers\n'Cause the end is nearer\nBut at least that's what they tellin' me\nHell, all I know brothers ain't ridin' 4-3 felony's\nIt's time to plan, plot, and strategize\nCapitalize, mobilize\nWe in the war, y'all\nIt's for all y'all\nMy family, to the ones that's standin'\nLittle bit mo' love is what's recommended\nYeah, and it's plain to see (Plain to see)\nThe seeds from you and me\nGon' be the ones to lead us towards unity\nThat's if we treat them right\nMan, teach them right\nRaise your kids better than you was\nAnd see what it does\nBut if you don't, man, we sure to be done\nAnd we'll all see exactly why the goods die young\n\n[Chorus: Val Young + (2Pac)]\nDoes anybody have an answer why\nIt seems the good die young\nCan anybody tell me why\nCan anybody tell me why\n(The good die young)\nDoes anybody have an answer why\nIt seems the good die young (Die young)\nCan anybody tell me why\nCan anybody tell me why\n(The good die young)\n\n[Outro: 2Pac]\nI send this out for all my homeboys that passed away\nAnd all yo' homeboys that passed away\nI send this out to all the former fallen soldiers\nThat's in the cemeteries buried\nNever got to see they dreams\nFor everything I touch you touch\nFor every step I take you take\nFor every breath I breathe you breathe\nEvery dollar I make you make\nI told you we'd make it to the sunshine one day\nYou just got there a little quicker\nBut like my homeboys Thugs say\n\"I'll catch you at the crossroads\"\nThe good die young\n\nThis for all the families that's in TWA Flight 800\nOklahoma, lil' Yummy Sandifer, Tasha Harlins\nAll the fallen kids, dead babies, closed caskets", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dbbdb7f208d5866d896da3ccaf431d59.681x681x1.jpg"}],
