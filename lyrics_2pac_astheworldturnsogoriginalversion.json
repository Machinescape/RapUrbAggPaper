Wisdom hard to swallow tomorrow, expect apologies\nYou probably panic, stranded in search of a better planet\nRealism hard to understand, we stand slanted\nAnd still stranded. Merciless thieves stole the best of me\nI pray to black Jesus to please take the rest of me\nAnd still, the best of us build and reach monetary gains\nSome of us kill, but still, most of us can change\nIf we search deeper\nGod bless the hustler, curse the first sleeper\nEnemies get beside me, flows go deep as Poseidon\nWhen we ride, plots keep all my enemies blinded\nTime will soon show, a thought can last for years\nOutshinin' your fake smiles, plastic tears\nLike last year, niggas stuck in the past, and it's clear\nJust some busta ass bastards allergic to cash this year\nMakaveli for the mob, M.O.B\nKillin' busters is my motherfuckin' job, him or me\nLyrically fatally driven, niggas reported missin'\nMy competition dead or in prison, as the world turns\u2026\n\n[Hook: (Darryl 'Big D' Harper) & 2Pac]\nTurns, turns, turns, turns and turns\nMy niggas grow and grow and grow\n(As The World Turns)\nGettin' dough and dough and dough\nFrom this state to that state\nFrom this cell to that cell, (As the world turns)\n\n[Verse 2: Kastro & (2Pac)]\nAin't no frontin' me I see my fucking soul, right in front of me\nYo Pac Cover Me, I'm in this thang for the luxury\nWassup with me I'm fuckin' chilling, Dreams of millions (Ya moms in this Bitch)\nTime to keep my green buildings, maintained with no fillings\nFor these weak motherfuckers, my heat street suckers (Weak ass tricks)\nNew street geek plucka', a long wrap without a rubba'\nListen to my Bompton, Outlaw blast the Compton, Gettin' half in pumpin (Jersey in this bitch)\nI cluck the razor slap it chocolate, Hey Now\nGot a lotta G's on the way now, Marcy and paydown\nMy niggas blownin' up, getting paid now\n\n[Verse 3: Hussein Fatal]\nPrecision in my favors, unanimous decision\nFuck a religion dead on collision with the walls of prison\nA street mercenary, lieutenant penned it\nMove it down like Emmett, only five minutes in it\nGot my town extended, Sadam Hussan\nA Big San, San Wan, I'm the first the bomb\nDear Mama I disrespected ways to your vagina\nHousehold de-ca, when the cops was behind ya'\nSome niggas got crippled, money still gettin' tripled\nSuckers'll stick you, I keep my hands on the pistol\nIt's drastic, niggas'll set you up for the casket\nFake teardrops, real closed casket they got it mastered\nUnprofessionally, I crawl with aggressional\nThoughts me and my gats, climbs apps like a sexual\nFor this pain and agony, I feel allegated gravity\nAnd my heart hurt, like I got voodoo pins stabbin' me\n(Ooh, shit)\n\n[Pre-Hook: 2Pac]\nRest in Peace Soldier (Rest in Peace Soldier)\nHaha\n\n[Hook: Darryl 'Big D' Harper & (2Pac)]\nAs The World Turns\n(And my niggas roll by, hahaha)\nAs The World Turns\n(Niggas get a swoll eye, and it don't stop and it don't quit\nThat real shit!)\nAs The World Turns\n(Niggas die for this, How many you niggas try to this?)\nAs The World Turns\n(Murderin' methods.. haha, OUTLAW!)\n\n[Verse 4: E.D.I.
