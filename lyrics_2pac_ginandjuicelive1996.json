Snoop?)\n\n[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]\nWith so much drama in the L-B-C\nIt's kind of hard bein' Snoop D-O-double-G\nBut I, somehow, some way\nKeep comin' up with funky-ass shit, like, every single day\nMay I kick a little something for the G's\nAnd make a few ends as I breach through?\nTwo in the mornin' and the party's still jumpin'\n\u2018Cause my momma ain't home\nI got bitches in the livin' room gettin' it on\nAnd they ain't leavin' till six in the mornin'\nSo what you wanna do?\nShit, I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too\nSo turn off the lights and close the doors\nBut (But what?) we don't love them hoes, yeah\nSo we gon' smoke a ounce to this (Sing that shit!)\nG's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this\n\n[Chorus]\nJust rollin'!\nJust rollin'!\nJust rollin'!\nLaid back, with my mind on my money\nAnd my money on my mind\n\nJust rollin'!\nJust rollin'!\nJust rollin'!\nLaid back, with my mind on my money\nAnd my money on my mind\n\n[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]\nNow that I got me some Seagram's gin\nEverybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in\nNow this type of shit happens all the time\nYou got to get yours but, fool, I gotta get mine\nEverything is fine when you listening to the D-O-G\nI got the cultivating music that be captivating he\nWho listens to the words that I speak\nAs I take me a drink to the middle of the street\nAnd get to mackin' to this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?)\nShe used to be my little nigga's lady (Oh, that bitch)\n80 degrees, when I tell that bitch please\nRaise up off these N-U-T's, \u2018cause you gets none of these\nAt ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound\nFeel the breeze, because I'm just\u2026\n\n[Chorus]\nJust rollin'!\nJust rollin'!\nJust rollin'!\nLaid back, with my mind on my money\nAnd my money on my mind\n\nJust rollin'!\nJust rollin'!\nJust rollin'!\nLaid back, with my mind on my money\nAnd my money on my mind\n\n[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]\nLater on that day, my homie Dr. Dre\nCame through with a gang of Tanqueray\nAnd a fat ass J of some bubonic chronic\nThat made me choke, shit, this ain't no joke\nI had to back up off of it and sit my cup down\nTanqueray and chronic, yeah, I'm fucked up now\nBut it ain't no stoppin', 'cause I'm still poppin'\nDre got some bitches from the city of Compton\nTo serve me, not with a cherry on top\n\u2018Cause when I get through, I gotta hit the dope spot\nDon't get upset, girl, that's just how it goes\nI don't love you, hoes, I'm out the door, and I'll be\n\n[Chorus]\nJust rollin'!\nJust rollin'!\nJust rollin'!\nLaid back, with my mind on my money\nAnd my money on my mind\n\nJust rollin'!\nJust rollin'!\nJust rollin'!\nWith my mind on my money\nAnd my money on my mind\n\n[Bridge 1: Snoop Dogg & (Audience)]\nLemme

\"LA, LA\"\nThem niggas don't know, they gang bang in LA, they love fighting\n(Killin' and shootin')\nStupid fucks (Sons of bitches)\nThat's why we drop it like we drop it\nSo don't think a nigga be trippin'\nWe just be tryna represent it for y'all to the fullest\nWhen they say something to us, we wanna make sure we mash they ass\nLike we did to Biggie, see that nigga quiet as a fuckin' church mouse\nDropped, hit him up, that nigga quiet as fuck\nHe ain't got shit to say\nHis wife pregnant, that nigga waitin' like an expecting father\nNot knowing who the baby is (Ha, ha, ha)\nThe world don't know I use the rubber so it ain't mine\nTell you straight\nI didn't wanna fuck that fat bitch no way (Just out of spite)\nBut you know, that's the secret to war\nHe my enemy, so she looked a'ight\nThen they tried to put my nigga on a case for murder and just lock his ass down forever\nLike it was kill-a-nigga season\nSnoop freaked they ass though, got out not guilty\nWe gonna drop his shit in a couple of months\nSnoop runnin' for president, he representin' the gangsta out here\nSo make some noise for Snoop, definitely runnin' for president\n(The gangsta party)", "image":
