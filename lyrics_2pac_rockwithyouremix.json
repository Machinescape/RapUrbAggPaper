Do you wanna fuck me?\nJust \u2018cause I'm paid in the worst way? True!\nLookin' kinda good in your birthday suit\nI wonder if you're wild and you act shy\nDo you like to be on top or the back side?\nWatch me while you lick your lips\nShake your hips, goddamn, I love that shit\nYo, let's stop fakin', be real now\nI got a room and a hard-on \u2013 still down?\nMet you standin' at a bar full of black dudes\nSaid you wanna see my scars and my tattoos\nWhen we head for my hideout, act right\nBoss player when I ride out, that's right\nWhat's ya phone number?\n\n(2Pac and Michael Jackson)\nYou got to feel that heat\nAnd we can ride the boogie, What's your phone number, Share that beat of lover Baby, let me give you a call\nHow long will it take to break you off?

Are you alone?\nGot a pocket full of rubbers, let's bone!\nTime for your girlfriend to take you home\nI had fun, but baby, gotta leave me alone\nPicture in my rhyme, take time to rewind these words I say\nIf you open your mind, bet in a minute you'll find\nIt's time let the Outlawz play\n\n\n(2Pac and Michael Jackson)\nWhen you feel that heat\nAnd we can ride the boogie, What's your phone number, Share that beat of lover Baby, let me give you a call\nHow long will it take to break you off?
